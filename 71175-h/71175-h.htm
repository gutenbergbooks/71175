BUNNY BROWN AND HIS<br>
SISTER SUE ON THE<br>
ROLLING OCEAN<br>
</p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="fs80">THE RUNAWAY HORSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny Brown stood behind a long board
which was laid across two boxes in the front
yard. On the board were some piles of white
stones and little heaps of red pebbles. There
were also clam shells, a few filled with white
sand and others with brown sand.</p>

<p>On one end of the board were some pieces
of paper cut into squares and near them was a
ball of string. On the other end of the board,
balanced on a small box, was a shingle. This
shingle moved up and down like the scales in
a grocery store. In fact, this shingle and the
box were Bunny Brown’s scale. He was
“playing store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I wonder if anybody is coming to
buy anything at my store to-day,” said Bunny,
as he paced up and down behind the counter.</p>

<p>Just then a little girl, carrying a doll under
one arm, walked up to the shade tree under
which the play store was. She went to the
counter and looked at the piles of sand, pebbles,
and the clam shells. But Bunny Brown
did not seem to think she was a little girl. He
bowed to her and asked:</p>

<p>“What will it be to-day, Mrs. Anderson?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny! You sound just like Mr. Gordon
in the real grocery store!” laughed Sue,
clapping her hands. As she did this her doll
fell down on the grass. “You’re just like Mr.
Gordon!” cried the little girl again.</p>

<p>Bunny Brown frowned, wrinkling his forehead
until it looked like a wash-board from
the laundry.</p>

<p>“Look here!” he exclaimed, coming out
from behind the counter. “I’m not going to
play store if you do that!”</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Sue, for it was Bunny
Brown’s sister Sue who had come to the store.
Bunny had called her “Mrs. Anderson,” but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
all the same, she was Sue Brown. “What did
I do, Bunny?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“There you go again!” cried Bunny. “Stop
calling me by my right name! If we’re going
to play store I’m Mr. Gordon and you’re Mrs.
Anderson!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, Bunny, but—”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you stop it?” cried the little boy,
dancing up and down in his excitement. “I’m
Mr. Gordon keeping the store!” he explained.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you are,” admitted Sue. “I
said you sounded just like Mr. Gordon when
mother goes in and he says what will it be to-day,
Mrs. Brown. You sounded just like him,
and—”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you must call me Mr. Gordon!”
insisted Bunny. “Now start over again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, Bun—I mean Mr. Gordon!”
and Sue quickly corrected herself. “Wait a
minute.”</p>

<p>She picked up her doll from the grass and,
imitating as nearly as she could the manner
of a grown woman, walked out of the store.
Of course the store was out of doors, in the
front yard of the Brown home, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
trees. But to Bunny the store was very real,
indeed. Bunny could “pretend” much harder
than could Sue, because, possibly, he was a
year older.</p>

<p>Sue—or Mrs. Anderson—having gone out,
turned about to come in again. Bunny was
once more behind the counter, looking at the
clam shells, the piles of pebbles, and the sand,
at his wrapping paper and twine and at the
swaying shingle on a box—his scales.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Anderson, what will
it be to-day?” again asked the little boy storekeeper
as he bowed to his sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, good morning, Mr. Gordon,” replied
Sue, and she did not even smile as she gave
her brother the pretend name. This showed
that Sue was now playing the game in real
earnest. “Have you any sugar this morning,
Mr. Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Anderson, I have some nice
fresh sugar that just came in,” Bunny answered,
acting so much like Mr. Gordon, the
real grocer, that Sue nearly smiled at him.
But she remembered just in time and her face
grew serious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Do you wish white sugar or brown, Mrs.
Anderson?” asked Bunny. I can call him that
without getting into trouble, you know.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a pound of white sugar, and two
pounds of brown,” answered Sue, or Mrs.
Anderson.</p>

<p>“Please have a seat while I weigh it for
you,” the little storekeeper went on.</p>

<p>In front of the counter there was a small
box. Pretending that this was a stool, such
as they sometimes have in real stores, Sue sat
down on it.</p>

<p>Then Bunny, taking up a stone for a weight,
put it on one end of the shingle scales. On
the other end of the shingle he piled up some
white sand, and when the shingle balanced,
that was a pound. He put the white sand in
one of the pieces of paper and tied a string
around it.</p>

<p>“There is your white sugar, Mrs. Anderson,”
he said to his sister. Sue took it but
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny, there’s a hole in the paper and
all the sand is running out! Look!”</p>

<p>Bunny Brown raised his hands in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“There you go again!” he cried. “Didn’t
I tell you to call me Mr. Gordon and not
Bunny? And that isn’t sand—it’s sugar! If
you aren’t going to play right—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny—I mean Mr. Gordon—I forgot!”
gasped Sue. “Truly, I did! Come on
and play!” she begged, for Bunny started to
walk out from behind the counter. “I won’t
do it again! Really, I won’t, Bun—I mean
Mr. Gordon! And I don’t care if this san—I
mean if the sugar spills. I have lots of
money and I can buy more,” and she looked
in her pocket where a mass of green leaves
from the lilac bush took the place of money.</p>

<p>“Well, all right,” said Bunny slowly, after
a moment. “But if you forget again I’m not
going to play!”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” promised Sue.</p>

<p>She placed the paper of sand-sugar down on
the counter in front of her, brushed some of
the grains off her doll’s dress and said:</p>

<p>“Now I’ll have some brown sugar, Mr.
Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Anderson,” said Bunny. “This
brown sugar is very sweet. Just taste it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>He held some of the brown sand out to his
sister. She looked at him in a funny way, and
Bunny cried:</p>

<p>“Go on—taste it!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Sue wet the end of her finger
and dipped it in the sand Bunny held out to
her on the end of a little board. Then Sue
put the sand on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>“Burr-r-r! Ugh! Oh, yes, it is very sweet
sugar!” she exclaimed, making a funny face
as she spluttered until the sand was out of her
mouth. “I think I’ll have two pounds of that,
Mr. Gordon.”</p>

<p>Bunny never smiled at the funny face his
sister made when she tasted the sand. When
Bunny played anything he was very much in
earnest, as I have told you.</p>

<p>He put another stone on the weight end of
the shingle scale. He then dipped out twice
as much brown sand as he had of the white
and wrapped this up in a paper which he tied
with a piece of string.</p>

<p>“There is the brown sugar, Mrs. Anderson,”
he said. “And now what else will there
be to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Bunny Brown acted so much like Sam Gordon,
the real grocer, and even imitated his
talk and manners so well, that Sue felt like
laughing. But she knew that if she did so her
brother would not play any more, so she kept
as straight a face as she could and said:</p>

<p>“Have you any fresh eggs, Mr. Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Mrs. Anderson, some very fresh
ones. They were picked just this morning!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny Brown, you don’t pick eggs!
They grow in the chicken coop!” giggled Sue.
And Bunny, knowing that he had made a mistake,
did not find fault this time with Sue for
calling him Bunny instead of Mr. Gordon.</p>

<p>“I mean,” corrected the little boy, “that the
eggs were laid fresh this morning.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take a dozen,” said Sue, getting
her face straight again.</p>

<p>Bunny picked up twelve of the larger white
pebbles and put these in an old cracker box,
of which he had several under the counter.</p>

<p>“Be careful not to break the eggs, Mrs. Anderson,”
he said, handing Sue the box. “Is
there anything else?”</p>

<p>“I think that’s all,” said Sue gravely, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
had heard her mother say. “How much is
it?”</p>

<p>Bunny pretended to be adding up the cost
of the pound of white sand-sugar, the two
pounds of the brown sand-sugar, and the price
of the dozen white-pebble-eggs.</p>

<p>“That’s a dollar and fifty-seven cents,” he
finally said.</p>

<p>Sue took out a large green leaf and two
smaller ones. And Bunny gave her back, in
change, two red petals from a rose.</p>

<p>“Come again, Mrs. Anderson,” he called as
Sue, tucking her doll under one arm and her
packages under the other, started away from
the play store. She walked across the grass
and down toward the bushes that grew as a
sort of hedge in front of the house.</p>

<p>As she neared the gate, Sue saw something
which caused her to cry out:</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Bunny! Look! Quick!”</p>

<p>“Say, didn’t I tell you I’m Mr. Gordon, the
grocer, and you mustn’t call me Bunny?”
cried the little boy. “Now I’m not going to
play store any more!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to play store!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Sue, who was much excited. “Look, Bunny!
It’s a runaway horse and he’s coming right
this way!”</p>

<p>This made Bunny forget all about being a
grocer. Out from behind the counter he ran
to join his sister near the gate. He saw, coming
down the street, a galloping horse on the
back of which was a man who either had lost
the bridle or who did not know how to manage
the animal.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sue, it is a runaway!” gasped Bunny,
and for the first time since the store game had
begun he called his sister by her right name.
“I wonder whose it is?”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s that man’s,” said Sue. “Look!
He’s coming right for us! I’m going to run!”</p>

<p>“He won’t come here!” said Bunny. “He
can’t jump over the bushes, Sue.”</p>

<p>The man on the back of the horse seemed
either frightened or excited. He was now
leaning forward, his arms around the neck of
the animal, and he cried:</p>

<p>“Avast there! Belay! Drop your anchor!
Pull up at the dock! I want to go ashore!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Bunny thought this was a funny way to talk
to a horse.</p>

<p>“He should say ‘whoa’ or ‘back’ to him,”
thought Bunny. “He’s talking just like
Bunker Blue or one of the sailors down at
daddy’s dock.”</p>

<p>But neither Bunny Brown nor his sister Sue
had time to think much more or do much
more. All of a sudden the horse came up on
the sidewalk near the Brown gate. Then, just
outside the hedge of bushes, the horse came to
a sudden stop.</p>

<p>Off his back shot the man, up into the air,
over the bushes in a curve, and then he fell to
the ground with a groan.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried Bunny’s sister Sue.</p>

<span class="fs80">A STRANGE STORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny Brown was as much excited and
frightened as his sister, but he did not scream
and call out as Sue did. Instead, Bunny
looked at the man, lying so still and quiet on
the grass. At first the little boy thought the
rider of the runaway horse had been killed
when he had been flung in such a queer way
over the fence.</p>

<p>But as Bunny looked he saw that the
strange man had landed on a pile of grass that
had been cut and raked up that morning by
Bunker Blue, a boy who worked at Mr.
Brown’s fish and boat dock.</p>

<p>“The pile of grass was like a cushion,”
thought Bunny to himself, remembering how
once he had fallen on a pile of hay in a field
when he and his sister were in the country on
Grandpa’s farm. Bunny had not been hurt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
by his fall, and he was hoping the man was
not much hurt by his tumble.</p>

<p>That the man was not dead was proved a
moment later when he moved slightly,
groaned and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s your name? Are you much
hurt?” asked Jed Winkler, who was in the
crowd that had rushed up the street after the
runaway.</p>

<p>“My name is Pott—Philip Pott,” was the
faint answer. “I was coming here to look for
my son. He’s lost—my son Harry is lost. At
least, so they say—went down with the
schooner <em>Mary Bell</em>. The treasure is lost too—the
treasure is gone! Oh, if I could only
find my lost son!” Then the man closed his
eyes and lay very quiet.</p>

<p>“He’s a sailor, just as I used to be!” exclaimed
old Jed Winkler, whom Bunny
Brown and his sister knew very well. “He’s
badly hurt, too. He’ll have to lay up in the
sick bay a spell, I reckon! Catch hold of him,
somebody, and we’ll lift him!”</p>

<p>While Bunny Brown and Sue looked on,
their mother and Uncle Tad, an old soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
who lived with the Brown family, came out
of the house.</p>

<p>“Bring the poor man into our house,” ordered
Mrs. Brown. “I have telephoned for
the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother! He fell off his horse right
in front of Bunny and me!” exclaimed Sue,
running toward her mother. “We were playing
store!”</p>

<p>“He flew right over the bushes,” added
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dears,” said Mrs. Brown. “But
run out of the way now until Uncle Tad and
Mr. Winkler carry the poor man into our
house.”</p>

<p>While this is being done I will take just a
moment to tell my new readers something of
the two children who are to take part in this
story.</p>

<p>Their names, as you have already been told,
were Bunny and Sue Brown. Their father’s
name was Walter Brown. He owned a boat
and fish business in the seacoast town of Bellemere.
He owned a pier which extended out
into Sandport Bay, and to this pier were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
brought the fish which his men caught in nets
off the coast.</p>

<p>The fish were packed in barrels of ice and
shipped to New York and other cities. Mr.
Brown also hired rowboats, sailing craft and
motor launches to those who wanted them.
He had men to help him, and also a chap
named Bunker Blue, who was a big, kindly
lad, very fond of Bunny and Sue. You first
met the children in the book called “Bunny
Brown and His Sister Sue,” which tells of the
funny adventures they had. After that, in
other books, you were told how the children
went to Grandpa’s farm, how they camped,
and of their visit to Aunt Lu, after which they
went to the big woods, then took an auto tour.</p>

<p>Once Bunny and Sue had had a Shetland
pony, and later a trick dog. You may guess
that they were fond of playing store, and once
they helped in a real store. Just before this
story opens, as related in the book, “Bunny
Brown and His Sister Sue at a Sugar Camp,”
the children had gone to the woods toward
the end of winter and had seen how maple
sugar was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Now it was summer again, and Bunny and
Sue were ready for more adventures. But
they were hardly prepared for seeing a man
tossed off the back of a runaway horse, over
their hedge, and almost at their feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny, do you s’pose he’s dead?”
whispered Sue to her brother as Uncle Tad,
Mr. Winkler, and another man lifted the unconscious
man who had said his name was
Philip Pott.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s not dead,” Bunny answered.
“He couldn’t talk if he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, maybe he’s hurt,” went on
Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he is hurt,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>The children started to go into the house,
following the men who were carrying the injured
sailor. Some other men and boys in the
street caught the runaway horse, which had
stopped as soon as it had tossed the man from
his back.</p>

<p>“Whose horse is it?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“It belongs to Jason’s livery stable,” said
Bunker Blue, coming along just then. “That’s
old Jim—I know that horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“All right, I’ll take him back to Mr. Jason,”
offered Sam Flack, a man who did odd jobs
about the town.</p>

<p>Bunker had come back from the boat and
fish dock to take away the pile of newly cut
grass he had raked up.</p>

<p>“Hi, Bunny, did the horse jump over the
hedge?” asked George Watson, one of Bunny’s
chums. A number of boys and girls had
gathered near the scene of the runaway.</p>

<p>“No, the horse didn’t go over the bushes—just
the man,” said Charlie Star, another chum
of the Brown children.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Harry Bentley.</p>

<p>“I saw him,” answered Charlie.</p>

<p>“So did I!” added Mary Watson. “Oh,
weren’t you ’cited—I mean excited—Sue?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was,” admitted Sue.</p>

<p>Sue and her brother went into the house,
following the men who had carried in Mr.
Pott, and Bunker Blue “shooed” the other
people out of the yard so he could gather up
the grass. Sam Flack led away the now
quieted horse.</p>

<p>The excitement was over for a time. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
many things were happening in the home of
Bunny Brown and his sister Sue.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown and Julia, the maid, had made
ready a couch in one of the rooms, and on this
the silent sailor was laid.</p>

<p>“Does he seem to be badly hurt?” asked
Mrs. Brown of Uncle Tad. “I have telephoned
for Dr. Rudd. He will be here in a
few minutes.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be hurt on the legs and in his
head, Mrs. Brown,” said Jed Winkler. “He’s
a sailor. I gathered that much from his talk.
Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I never saw him before,” Mrs. Brown answered.
“I was looking out, watching Bunny
and Sue playing store, when I saw this horse
come galloping down the street. Then it
stopped so quickly that the poor man was
pitched off over the hedge.”</p>

<p>“He almost landed on me,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“On me, too,” added Sue, who did not like
to be left out of anything in which her brother
had a part.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudd came in a few minutes later and
looked Mr. Pott over. The injured sailor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
soon felt better. He opened his eyes and
looked about him.</p>

<p>“Hello! Where am I? What ship is this?”
asked the man in a weak voice.</p>

<p>“You aren’t on any ship, my good man,”
said the doctor. “You are in Mr. Brown’s
house. Can you tell us who you are and
where you want to go?”</p>

<p>The man looked around at the faces, which
were strange to him, and said:</p>

<p>“I don’t know any Mr. Brown.”</p>

<p>“We’re the Browns,” explained Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s my mother’s name and my father’s
name and Bunny’s name and my name!” exclaimed
Sue. “And you’re in our house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, am I? Thank you, little girl,” said
Mr. Pott, smiling at her. “How did I get
here?”</p>

<p>“You were riding a horse and it ran away
and threw you. Don’t you remember?” asked
Uncle Tad.</p>

<p>“You spoke of the schooner <em>Mary Bell</em>,”
said Jed Winkler. “You’re a sailor, I take it,
same as I used to be. I’m sorry to see you in
trouble, messmate? Can I help you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Pott looked at Jed Winkler a minute
and then said:</p>

<p>“Well, you might help me if you could find
the lost treasure.”</p>

<p>“What lost treasure?” asked Dr. Rudd, and
Bunny and Sue remembered a sea story their
mother sometimes read to them about a shipwreck
in which treasure had been lost and
later was found on a desert island.</p>

<p>“The treasure was lost on the <em>Mary Bell</em>,”
murmured Mr. Pott. “She foundered, the
<em>Mary Bell</em> did, down in southern waters. I
was first mate aboard of her and my son Harry
was second mate. But I guess he’s lost too—my
boy Harry. He was sick just before the
<em>Mary Bell</em> began to sink. I haven’t had any
word from him since.</p>

<p>“But I thought maybe he got picked up at
sea somehow, and I’ve been going about ever
since, trying to find him. Every time I heard
of a place where a sailor lived I went there,
thinking it might be my son Harry. I thought
maybe he might have the lost treasure. I
heard there was a sailor living here, so I came
to this port.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>“I guess I’m the only sailor living here,”
said Mr. Winkler. “But I’m not your son and
I haven’t any treasure.”</p>

<p>“You have Wango, your monkey,” said
Bunny, for he and Sue liked the queer, fuzzy,
little animal that Jed had brought back with
him from one of his voyages.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have Wango, but he isn’t any treasure,”
chuckled the old sailor. “Anyhow, my
sister Euphemia doesn’t think so.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue well knew this. They wondered
what else the injured sailor would say.
They had listened to his strange story, and
they wondered what his treasure was and if
he would ever find his lost son Harry.</p>

<p>After telling this much about himself Mr.
Pott became unconscious.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask him how it was he came
to be riding that horse,” said Mr. Winkler.
“A horse is no sort of craft for a sailor.”</p>

<p>“It will be better not to ask him any more
questions for a while,” said Dr. Rudd, “even
if he regains consciousness. Shall I have the
ambulance come and take him away, Mrs.
Brown?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, not yet. Let the poor man stay
here,” said Bunny’s mother. “It might hurt
him to move him. Later, if you find he needs
hospital treatment, he can go there. But let
him stay here for the time being.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and Dr. Rudd said he
would come in again that afternoon. Bunny
and Sue were looking at the strange sailor
when their mother called:</p>

<p>“Here comes daddy. I suppose he heard
that something had happened at home and
came up from the dock to see about it.”</p>

<p>The footsteps of some one walking in the
hall were heard. Bunny and Sue knew their
father’s tread. Then the voice of Mr. Brown
called:</p>

<p>“Where are you, Bunny? And where’s
Sue? I’ve great news for you!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="fs80">WONDERFUL NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny Brown and his sister Sue made a
rush for the hall to meet their father. In
fact, they always ran to meet him as soon as
they heard him enter the house. But this time,
because he called out that he had great news
for them, there was an extra reason for hurrying.</p>

<p>“Don’t make too much noise, my dears,”
said Mrs. Brown, motioning to the injured
sailor.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t hear them,” said Uncle Tad,
who was sitting beside Mr. Pott. “He’s off
in a stupor now. I’m afraid he’s going to be
a very sick man.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” murmured Mrs. Brown. “If
we could only find his son and get word to
him about his father.”</p>

<p>“Likely the son will never be found,” replied
Uncle Tad in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>“Well, we’ll take care of this poor man
until Dr. Rudd sees him again,” went on
Mrs. Brown. “By that time he may be better.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue found their father out in the
hall. Generally they rushed at him with
merry peals of laughter and jolly shouts. But
now they had heard what their mother said
about disturbing Mr. Pott, so they were a little
quieter.</p>

<p>“What’s the great news, Daddy?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Are we going away somewhere?” Sue
wanted to know. To travel was the delight
of the two children, and nothing pleased them
so much as to be on the move—it did not much
matter where, as long as they were seeing
something new. But probably most children
are like that.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think perhaps we are going away—on
the rolling ocean,” said Mr. Brown. “I’ll
tell you more about it in a little while. But
what is going on here? Some one told me
there had been an accident here, though I see
it isn’t either of you two who is hurt. And it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
can’t be mother, for I hear her talking to
Uncle Tad.”</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Pott,” explained Bunny. “He’s
a sailor and he lost his son Harry and the
treasure and he was on a horse.”</p>

<p>“But he fell off the horse,” quickly added
Sue. “And, Daddy, he ’most fell on us when
we played store!”</p>

<p>“My! I should say that was a lot to have
happen to one,” said Mr. Brown. “Now
don’t make too much noise if we have a sick
man in the house.”</p>

<p>He went into the room where his wife and
Uncle Tad were keeping watch over Mr. Pott,
and from Mrs. Brown soon learned all there
was to know about the matter.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Mr. Brown. “Well, perhaps
things may turn out all right after all,
but it’s pretty hard for the old man to lose his
son and a treasure at the same time.”</p>

<p>Making the sailor as comfortable as possible,
and leaving Uncle Tad to watch over him,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown and the children went
to another room where they could talk together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“What’s this about some news the children
say you have?” asked Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“It is news, yes, in a way,” answered her
husband. “How would you like to take a
trip?”</p>

<p>“It depends on where the trip is,” his wife
said, with a smile. “If I had my choice I
would like to go down south where it is lovely
and warm and where there are so many flowers
and birds.”</p>

<p>“You must have guessed what I was going
to say,” laughed Mr. Brown, “for down south
is where I was thinking of going.”</p>

<p>“Is it down to the sunny south where we
were once before?” asked Bunny. The Brown
children had once taken a trip to the southland.</p>

<p>“Not exactly the same place,” Mr. Brown
replied. “Of course, the south is always
sunny, but this time I have in mind an ocean
voyage. I have to go to the West Indies on
business, and I have a chance to go on a
steamer which one of the big fish companies
is sending. They have given me the use of
two staterooms, so there will be room for all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
us. If you want to go and take the children,
my dear,” he said to his wife, “I think it
would be a pleasant trip for us all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we could very well leave
them at home,” remarked Mrs. Brown, looking
at Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>“Leave us at home? I guess not!” cried
Bunny. “I wouldn’t stay!”</p>

<p>“And if Bunny doesn’t stay at home I’m not
going to stay!” announced Sue, almost ready
to cry.</p>

<p>“There, now, don’t get excited,” laughed
Mr. Brown. “No one is going to be left at
home.”</p>

<p>“And are we really going on the ocean?”
asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“To get to the West Indies down near Cuba
we must go on the ocean,” answered Mr.
Brown. “But though the ocean may roll a bit,
it will not be very rough, if that’s what you’re
thinking of.”</p>

<p>“Tell me more about it,” begged Mrs.
Brown, while the children listened.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t all settled yet,” Mr. Brown
replied. “But, as you know, I sell some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
my fish to the Empire Sea Food Company of
Philadelphia. One of their men was in to see
me the other day and told of an especial trip
one of their steamers was going to make to the
West Indies. They are to look up new places
from which they may have southern fish
shipped to them. This man said there would
be plenty of room on the <em>Beacon</em>, which is the
name of the steamer. She isn’t going to carry
regular passengers, just the crew, some members
of the fish company, and some of the
wives of the officers of the company.</p>

<p>“So, as he offered me the use of two staterooms,
which will be just enough for us, I
thought perhaps you and the children might
like to go. I can leave my head clerk and
Bunker Blue in charge of my business here,
and Uncle Tad can look after the house. So
there is no reason why we can’t all go on the
rolling ocean.”</p>

<p>“I think I should love it,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Are we going to-morrow?” Sue wanted to
know. “’Cause if we are, I’ve got to put a
new dress on my doll.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we won’t go to-morrow!” laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
her father. “Perhaps not for a week yet.
You’ll have plenty of time to dress Sallie Ann,
if that’s the name of your doll.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sue, thinking the matter over,
“I haven’t any doll named Sallie Ann. But,”
she added quickly, “if you would get me a new
doll I could name her Sallie Ann.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho, you little tyke! So that’s what
you’re thinking of, are you?” exclaimed Mr.
Brown, catching Sue up in his arms. “Well,
we’ll see about the new doll later on. But if
you think it is settled about making the trip,
I’ll send word to Captain Ward of the <em>Beacon</em>
so our staterooms will be made ready.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think we’ll take the trip,” said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>Just then Sue called:</p>

<p>“Oh, look at Bunny! What’s he doing?”</p>

<p>Well might she ask that, for Bunny was
moving about the room, reeling from side to
side, heaving and rolling his shoulders and
head as though trying to turn himself inside
out.</p>

<p>“Bunny! What’s the matter?” called his
mother. “Are you ill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“No, I’m not sick!” replied Bunny, straightening
up. “I’m just making believe I’m on a
ship on the rolling ocean. The ocean rolls,
daddy said, and I’m rolling. I’m on the rolling
ocean! The rolling ocean!” With a
laugh, Bunny again made his shoulders move
in that funny way, imitating the heaving and
swaying of a ship in the swell of the sea.</p>

<p>“You’ll get plenty of that before we reach
the West Indies,” said Mr. Brown. “The
ocean will roll for you all you want it to.”</p>

<p>“I like the ocean,” announced the little boy.
“I’m going to fish in it when we get on the
steamer.”</p>

<p>“And maybe you’ll catch a crab and it will
pinch you,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“I like crabs,” declared Bunny.</p>

<p>“I don’t,” stated Sue. “I don’t like ’em
alive! Once I got pinched by a crab.” This
was true. The children had gone out fishing
in Sandport Bay with Bunker Blue once upon
a time. A crab had been caught and before
Sue could get out of the way of the queer,
sidewise-moving creature, it had nipped her
on the leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“Well, since it is all settled that we are to
go on the rolling ocean,” announced Mr.
Brown, “I’ll send word to Captain Ward. He
asked me to let him know, and—”</p>

<p>“Hark!” suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Brown,
holding up her hand for silence.</p>

<p>A noise sounded in the other room where
Mr. Pott had been put. The voice of the
sailor could be heard murmuring, and Uncle
Tad was answering him.</p>

<p>“I must see what’s the matter,” said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<span class="fs80">MR. POTT GOES AWAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Keeping Bunny and Sue in the background,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown looked in the room
where Uncle Tad was watching over Mr.
Pott.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” whispered Mrs.
Brown, for when she and her husband looked
in the room the injured man seemed to be
quiet and there was no longer the murmur of
voices.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now,” said Uncle Tad in low
tones. “But he was a bit restless a moment
ago. He was sort of talking in his sleep, I
guess, about his missing son and the lost treasure.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think he lost a treasure?”
asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Uncle Tad slowly, “you know
how it is with sick folks. Sometimes they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
imagine things. I know how it was in the
army. Sometimes the men that were hurt
would talk a lot about things that had never
happened. They were wandering in their
minds.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Pott lost his son—he told us so,”
remarked Bunny. He and Sue stood just outside
the door.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sue, “he did. When he fell
off the horse and came into our yard and sat
on the pile of grass, he said he’d lost his
son.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe he did, and a treasure, too,”
agreed Mr. Brown. “Perhaps in the morning
he’ll be better able to tell us more about himself
and how he happened to come here.”</p>

<p>“He came here because he heard there was
a sailor living here,” explained Mrs. Brown.
“He thought it might be his son who had been
rescued from the wreck of the <em>Mary Bell</em>.
But the only sailor we have here is Jed Winkler.”</p>

<p>“And he’s too old to have been this man’s
son,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>The sick man had grown quiet again, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Mrs. Brown sent Julia, the maid, in to watch
by his couch while Uncle Tad had a rest.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by the runaway
horse had passed, the animal having been
taken back to the livery stable where Mr. Pott
had hired it. Bunker Blue raked up the pile
of grass and put it back of the Brown garage
where later some stray goats came and ate
it.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue, forgetting for a time about
the strange sailor in their house, ran out to
play again.</p>

<p>“But don’t let’s play store again,” suggested
Bunny.</p>

<p>“What’ll we play?” Sue wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Let’s play about the rolling ocean,” suggested
Bunny, whose mind seemed filled with
thoughts of the great sea. “We’ll make believe
the store counter is a ship, and I’ll be the captain
and you can be a passenger and we’ll go
to the West Indies.”</p>

<p>“And maybe we’ll find Mr. Pott’s lost son,”
added Sue.</p>

<p>“I’d rather find the treasure,” said Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Neither he nor his sister dreamed of the
strange adventures that were soon to be theirs.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue so often made believe that
it did not take them long to change the “store”
into an ocean-going steamer. The long plank
that had served for a counter was laid on two
lower boxes, for, as it was, it was too high for
the deck of a ship. Then Bunny placed one
box up in front of the plank.</p>

<p>“This is where the captain steers the ship,”
he said.</p>

<p>He placed another box behind the first at
the farther end of the plank.</p>

<p>“That’s the cabin for passengers,” he told
Sue. “You get in there, and be careful you
don’t fall into the water.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any water,” remarked Sue.</p>

<p>“You don’t?” cried Bunny Brown. “Why,
there’s water all around us! How do you
s’pose a ship’s going to sail on the rolling
ocean if it doesn’t go in the water? This grass
all around us is water, and you’d better get on
board else you’ll be drowned. You’re in the
water now!” and he pointed to Sue’s feet.</p>

<p>“I am not in the water!” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“You are so!” asserted Bunny. “And if you
don’t get on board quick, the steamer’ll go off
without you! Toot! Toot!” and he pretended
to blow a whistle.</p>

<p>“Then you’re in the water, too,” retorted
Sue, pointing to Bunny’s feet which were also
on the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s nothing! Captains have to
be in the water! Anyhow, I’m going to get
up and steer the boat. So if you want to play
you’ve got to get on, too.”</p>

<p>Bunny made a jump and landed on the
plank. Then he took his place in the forward
box. Sue was going to get aboard when she
happened to think of something.</p>

<p>“Bunny,” she called.</p>

<p>“I’m not Bunny!” he answered. “I’m Captain
Ward.” He remembered the name of the
commander of the <em>Beacon</em> spoken of by Mr.
Brown. “You have to call me Captain Ward
if you’re going to play steamboat,” he told his
sister.</p>

<p>“All right. Captain Ward,” and Sue did
not smile when she said this, “could I take one
of my dolls on your steamer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Doll? No!” cried Bunny. “You’re supposed
to be a big woman passenger and they
don’t have dolls. But if you want to take your
little girl in your cabin, you can do that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, Captain Ward. Thank
you,” quickly answered Sue, understanding
what Bunny meant. If you were pretending,
you must do it in everything. And since she
was pretending to be a grown-up passenger
she would not, naturally, have a doll. But
she could make believe her doll was her little
girl. “I’ll go and get my daughter now.” She
had already taken her place on the “ship,” but
now, as she was about to get off, she remembered
that the grass was “water.”</p>

<p>“How am I going to get my daughter?” she
asked. “I can’t jump into the ocean to go for
her,” and she pointed to the grass.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Bunny. “Wait! I’ll
steer the ship up to the pier and you can go
ashore there and get your daughter. Look
out now, hold tight! We’re going fast!
Toot! Toot!”</p>

<p>Sue held “tight,” and though of course the
plank and the boxes did not move from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
place where they had formerly been part of
the “store,” still to the children it was as if
they were sailing on the rolling ocean.</p>

<p>“Whoa!” suddenly called Bunny. “We’re
at the pier now,” he added to his sister. “You
can go ashore and get your doll—I mean your
daughter,” he quickly corrected himself.</p>

<p>Sue began to laugh.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Bunny. He
did not like to have his sister laugh when he
was pretending in real earnest.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Sue. “You told the
ship to whoa like a horse. You shouldn’t say
whoa to a ship. You’ve got to tell it to halt,
Bunny Brown.”</p>

<p>Then Bunny saw he had made a mistake.
But in turn he laughed at Sue.</p>

<p>“You don’t say halt to a ship,” he declared.
“You only say halt to soldiers, and we aren’t
playing soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, you don’t say whoa to a
ship,” declared Sue.</p>

<p>“No, I guess you don’t,” admitted Bunny.
“Well, anyhow, the ship has stopped and
we’re at Pier Number Three and you can go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
ashore without getting in the water now and
bring your daughter on board,” he said.</p>

<p>“All right,” Sue agreed.</p>

<p>So she again stepped in the grass, but this
time it was not water, but the floor boards of
the pier, so of course she could not get wet.
Up to the house she ran to get one of her dolls,
and soon she was back on board the <em>Beacon</em>.
She found Bunny making a loud hissing noise.</p>

<p>“What you doing?” Sue asked. “Are you
playing wild animals? You sound like a
snake. I don’t want to play wild animals. I
want to play ship.”</p>

<p>“I am playing ship,” declared Bunny. “I’m
the engine blowing off steam. Don’t you know
steam when you hear it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s steam, all right,” agreed Sue. “I
thought you were a snake.”</p>

<p>“All aboard!” cried Bunny Brown. “Toot!
Toot! All aboard!”</p>

<p>Again Sue stepped on the grass, which was
not water because it was a pier, and soon she
was in her box cabin.</p>

<p>Bunny started the ship off once more, hissing
to show that steam was blowing out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
pipes and now and then whistling to tell other
ships to get out of his path.</p>

<p>Sue held her “daughter” in her arms and
pretended to show her whales and sharks as
they sailed along the grassy-green rolling
ocean.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Bunny left his place in the forward
box and walked back along the plank
toward his sister Sue. Bunny held out his
hand to Sue as if he wanted something.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Captain Ward?” asked
the little girl.</p>

<p>“I’m not Captain Ward now,” Bunny answered.
“I’m the conductor and I want your
ticket.”</p>

<p>“They don’t have conductors on ships,” retorted
Sue. “They have conductors on trolley
cars and steam cars.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m the ticket-taker, anyhow, and
you’ve got to give me a ticket or I’ll put you
off the ship,” announced Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, I’ll give you a ticket,” agreed
Sue.</p>

<p>She put her hand in her pocket and pulled
out one of the green leaves which a little while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
before she had used as money when she and
Bunny were playing store.</p>

<p>“There’s my ticket,” said the little girl.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed her brother, looking closely
at it, “I see it’s a ticket all right. You’re going
to the West Indies, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sue, “to the West Indies.”</p>

<p>Bunny punched the ticket by putting a hole
in the leaf with a small twig. Then he held
out his hand again.</p>

<p>“What you want now?” asked Sue. “I gave
you my ticket.”</p>

<p>“I must have a ticket for that child,” said
Bunny sternly. “She’s more’n five years old.”</p>

<p>Once he had been on a street car with his
mother and he had heard the conductor say
this to a woman with a little girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, Annabell is more’n five years old,”
Sue said. “But I didn’t know I had to have a
ticket for her.”</p>

<p>“Well, you have to,” declared Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” agreed Sue, and she handed
out another green leaf.</p>

<p>Bunny tore the leaf in two and gave Sue
back a part of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>“What’s this for—my change?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It takes only a half ticket for little girls,”
announced Bunny, as he punched half the leaf
with his twig-puncher. “I hope you have a
nice trip to the West Indies,” he said to passenger
Sue.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” echoed the little girl. “Do you
think it will be very rough on the rolling
ocean, Captain Ward?” she asked, for now
Bunny, being back in his steering box, was in
command of the ship.</p>

<p>“Yes, we may have a very bad storm,” he
said. “But don’t be afraid, Mrs. Anderson,
I’ll bring you and your daughter safe to the
West Indies.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” returned Sue politely.</p>

<p>So the children played, having much fun on
the “steamboat” they had made so simply out
of a plank and some boxes. They sailed to the
West Indies and back. Then they made a trip
to the north pole, and, landing there, Bunny
and Sue, though under an apple tree, played
they were in one of the igloos, or snow huts,
of the Eskimos.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day the children played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
at one game or another, and when night came
they were tired and ready to go to sleep.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Pott any worse?” asked Bunny, as
he and Sue were getting ready for bed that
night.</p>

<p>“No, I think he isn’t any worse,” his mother
answered. “But he doesn’t seem to be any better,
either. Dr. Rudd, who was here a while
ago, will see him again in the morning.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t find his lost son or the treasure,
did he?” Sue wanted to know.</p>

<p>“No, dear. Now go to bed and don’t think
any more about it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to think of the fun we’ll have on
the rolling ocean,” said Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” murmured his sister Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be best,” their mother told
them.</p>

<p>The children looked in at Mr. Pott the next
morning, but he lay with eyes closed and did
not see them. Then Bunny and Sue went to
the store for their mother. They were gone
about an hour. When they came back they
saw Uncle Tad opening the windows in the
room where the sick man had been. And they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
could look in and see that Mr. Pott was no
longer on the couch.</p>

<p>“Where’s he gone?” cried Bunny.
“Where’s Mr. Pott?”</p>

<p>“He has gone away,” said Mrs. Brown.
“Dr. Rudd came and found that the poor man
was much worse, so he decided to send him to
the hospital. He can be better taken care of
there than here. They took him to the hospital
while you were at the store.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Bunny Brown. After a
moment he asked: “Could we go to the hospital
to see him?”</p>

<p>“Some time, I guess—maybe,” answered
Mrs. Brown. But she was so busy that she
hardly knew what she was saying.</p>

<span class="fs80">AT THE HOSPITAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny and Sue were so fond of playing
and had so many things to do, and their chums
came into the yard and they all had such good
times playing steamboat again, that the little
boy and girl did not think much more about
Mr. Pott and his missing son and treasure. In
fact, Bunny and Sue did not again remember
about Mr. Pott until one day when they happened
to be out under one of the apple trees
on which the fruit was still green, for this
was early summer.</p>

<p>Then, as Bunny saw some of the fruit which
had been blown by the wind down on the
ground, a sudden idea came to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sue!” he cried. “I know what we can
do!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the little girl, always ready
to follow the lead of her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“We can go to the hospital!” announced
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Why do we want to go to the hospital?”
asked Sue. “You aren’t sick and I don’t need
a doctor.”</p>

<p>“We can go to the hospital to see Mr. Pott,”
went on Bunny. “Always, when anybody is
sick, people go to the hospital to see them—I
mean well people, and we’re well. We can
take things to the hospital for Mr. Pott.”</p>

<p>“What can we take him?” asked Sue, falling
in with the idea.</p>

<p>“Apples,” announced Bunny. “Always they
take fruit to folks that are sick in the hospital.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and flowers, too,” said Sue. “Once
Sadie West’s mother was sick in the hospital
and Sadie took her flowers.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we can take flowers, too,” agreed
Bunny. “There are flowers growing over
there,” and he pointed to a distant meadow
gay with dandelions and daisies. “You pick
a lot of flowers, Sue, and I’ll get some of these
apples and we’ll take them to Mr. Pott in the
hospital. In a basket,” he added. “You have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
to take stuff to people in a hospital in a basket.
I’ll get a basket.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll pick the flowers,” agreed Sue.
“Oh, this’ll be lots of fun, won’t it, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Lots of fun,” agreed the little boy. “Mr.
Pott’ll be glad to get the apples and the flowers.”</p>

<p>Sue crawled through the fence to go to the
meadow to pick a bouquet of daisies and dandelions
while Bunny ran back to the house to
get a basket. He met Bunker Blue who had
been sent to the house by Mr. Brown on an
errand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bunker!” called Bunny to the big,
red-haired youth.</p>

<p>“Hello,” answered Bunker. “Going fishing,
Bunny?” he asked when he saw the basket
which the little boy had found in the woodshed.
It was a basket used to bring chips into
the house for starting the fire.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not going fishing,” gravely answered
Bunny, as he started back to the apple
tree.</p>

<p>“Where are you going then?” Bunker Blue
wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>“To the hospital,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the fish boy. “You
aren’t sick! What are you going to the hospital
for?” As Bunny kept on without answering,
Bunker said to himself: “I guess he was
making believe as he and Sue are always doing.
Going to the hospital! Ho! ho! That’s
pretty good!” He did not really think Bunny
meant what he had said.</p>

<p>But Bunny and Sue were very much in earnest.
The little boy reached the apple tree
and, looking over in the meadow, saw his sister
gathering the flowers.</p>

<p>“Pick a nice bouquet,” he called to her.</p>

<p>“I will,” she answered. “I found some buttercups,
too.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Bunny. “Buttercups
are good for sick folks in hospitals. I’ll put
all the apples I can find in the basket.”</p>

<p>The apples on the ground were mostly those
that were wormy, which was the reason they
had fallen from the tree so early. And looking
at some of this fruit Bunny decided it was
not very nice.</p>

<p>“But there are nice apples up on the tree,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
he said to himself. “I’m going to climb up
and pick some.”</p>

<p>The apple tree was a low one, and to as active
a boy as was Bunny Brown it was not at
all hard to climb. So up he scrambled, leaving
his basket on the ground.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Sue, having picked as many
dandelions, buttercups and daisies as her
hands would hold, crawled back under the
fence. She looked beneath the apple tree for
Bunny, but did not see him.</p>

<p>“Bunny! Bunny! Where are you?” she
called. “I see your basket but I don’t see
you!”</p>

<p>Just then a good, green apple fell at Sue’s
feet. By good is meant that the apple was not
wormy, though it was not ripe, either. As
Sue saw and heard the apple fall she looked
up, saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, it nearly hit me!”</p>

<p>She saw the branches and leaves rustling
and then her brother’s voice called:</p>

<p>“I’m up here, Sue. I’m picking better apples
for Mr. Pott. Those on the ground are
wormy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad you’re up there,” Sue said.
“I thought maybe you’d run home. Anyway,
there’s a cow over where I picked the flowers.
Maybe she’ll hook me.”</p>

<p>“Cows don’t hook people,” announced
Bunny, as he picked some apples and put them
in his pocket, now and then losing his hold on
one so that it fell to the ground. “Only bulls
hook people,” said the little fellow. “Cows
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, she’s shaking her horns at
me,” replied Sue. “Maybe she doesn’t like it
that I picked flowers in her meadow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess she doesn’t care,” stated
Bunny. “Look out now, I’m coming down.”</p>

<p>Sue stood out of the way and Bunny scrambled
from the tree. He had plenty of green
apples now, and with those picked off the
ground, using only the best of them, and with
Sue’s flowers, the basket was now quite filled.</p>

<p>“We’ll go to the hospital now,” said Bunny,
as he and Sue stuck the daisies, buttercups and
dandelions in among the apples. “Mr. Pott
will be glad to see us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he will,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>There was only one hospital in Bellemere,
and the children knew where it was, as it was
not far from their house. So they walked
along toward it, turning from the orchard out
into a side street, which did not take them past
their home. If they had gone past carrying
that queer looking basket of fruit and flowers
and if Mrs. Brown had seen them, she would
very likely not have let them go.</p>

<p>As it was, Bunny and Sue tramped along
the streets, and more than one man and woman
turned to look at the two pretty children for
they made a beautiful picture, carrying the
basket between them.</p>

<p>When Bunny and Sue made up their minds
to do anything, they went right ahead with it.
They were not bashful or afraid. Just now
their minds were so filled with doing what
they thought was a kindness to Mr. Pott that
there was not any room for thoughts of being
afraid.</p>

<p>So they marched boldly up the front steps
of the hospital and into the reception room,
where a pleasant-faced nurse, wearing a white
uniform and a white cap, met them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“How do you do, children,” she greeted
them.</p>

<p>“Hello,” answered Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“We have come—we’ve come to your hospital,”
added Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you?” asked the nurse, smiling.
“Well, we’re glad to see you. But you don’t
look as if you needed hospital treatment;
either of you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no’m, we aren’t sick!” Bunny made
haste to say. “But Mr. Pott’s sick, and we
brought him something to eat.”</p>

<p>“The apples are to eat,” quickly said Sue,
lest a mistake be made and the flowers served
as a meal. “We brought the apples for Mr.
Pott to eat, and he can smell the flowers. But
if he gets them too near his nose they’ll make
his nose yellow, the buttercups will. My nose
is yellow—look!” and she held her nose up to
the nurse.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see your nose is a little yellow,”
and the nurse laughed quietly. “How did it
happen?”</p>

<p>“I smelled a buttercup too close,” said Sue.
“Mr. Pott’s nose will be yellow, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, if he smells a buttercup it will,”
agreed the nurse.</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Bunny. “If you’ll
tell us, if you please,” he added, remembering
his manners, “we’ll take these apples up to
him, and the flowers, too.”</p>

<p>“The flowers ought to be put in water,” put
in Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose they ought,” agreed the
nurse. “If you will give your basket to me I
will see that the flowers are put in water and
placed in Mr. Pott’s room. He’ll like them,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“He’ll like the apples, too,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>To this the nurse made no answer. But as
she looked at the green fruit in the basket she
could not help laughing, though she took care
not to let Bunny or Sue see her mirth. The
children were taken in charge by another
nurse who entered just then and to whom the
first nurse explained matters.</p>

<p>“They want to see Mr. Pott?” said this
nurse, who was called Miss Mantin.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who they are, but they
brought some fruit and flowers. I’ll take care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
of the basket,” said the first nurse, glancing at
the second nurse and picking up one of the
green apples.</p>

<p>“Yes, put the fruit away for him. He
couldn’t eat it just now, for he had some lunch
only a little while ago,” Miss Mantin said to
Bunny and Sue. “But the flowers can go right
up to his bedside. He will like to look at
them. And now, whose children are you? Is
Mr. Pott your father?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Sue.</p>

<p>“I’m Bunny Brown and this is my sister
Sue,” explained the little boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, now I remember. It was from
your house that Mr. Pott was brought here,”
said the second nurse, Miss Mantin, who was
in charge of the hospital. “Well, I think you
can see Mr. Pott for just a few moments. He
is very ill and not altogether right in his head.
Sometimes he wanders in his talk. But he
may know you when he sees you. Come
along.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t we give him the apples and flowers?”
asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Miss Wilson, the nurse you met first, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
attend to that,” said the manager, and she
smiled a little.</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Pott’s son Harry come to see him
yet?” asked Bunny, as he and his sister followed
the manager along the clean halls.</p>

<p>“No one has been to see him yet except the
doctor,” was the answer. “I didn’t know he
had a son Harry.”</p>

<p>“He has. He was lost in a wreck, and so
was the treasure lost,” explained Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad,” remarked Miss Mantin,
the manager.</p>

<p>She led the children upstairs to a clean,
white room, where, in a clean, white bed lay
the man who had been tossed off his horse
and hurt. Another nurse was coming out of
the room as the children and Miss Mantin
approached.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Pott able to see any one, Miss
Wentworth?” asked Miss Mantin.</p>

<p>“I think so,” was the answer. “He has been
talking to me and seems some better.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue were led into the room.
Mr. Pott looked at them, but he did not seem
to remember them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” he asked
them.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know us?” asked Sue.
“You fell off your horse in our yard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the man in a weak voice.
“I know something happened to my horse.
But you aren’t my son Harry, are you?” he
asked Bunny. “No, you can’t be my son—he’s
much bigger than you!” went on Mr.
Pott before Sue’s brother had a chance to answer.
“My son was on the schooner <em>Mary
Bell</em> when she foundered. Harry was sick and
I guess he didn’t get off. He wasn’t in my
boat, but maybe another boat picked him up.
Poor Harry! He’s gone, and so is my treasure.
Harry was lost in the West Indies.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue started and looked surprised
as they heard the name of these islands. Miss
Mantin saw this and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know this man’s son, children?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, ma’am,” said Bunny. “But we’re
going to the West Indies on a steamboat
soon.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we could find his son!” added Sue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
“Oh, Bunny, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we
could?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Bunny, “very wonderful!”</p>

<p>Then a change came over Mr. Pott. He
tossed restlessly on the bed and cried out:</p>

<p>“Avast! Belay there! Drop the anchor!
We’re sinking! Where are you, Harry?
Save the treasure!”</p>

<p>“He is out of his mind again,” said the
nurse softly. “You had better go home, children.”</p>

<span class="fs80">OFF ON THE TRIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Feeling very sorry for Mr. Pott, Bunny
and Sue walked down the stairs and toward
the front door of the hospital. They had done
their best to be kind to him by bringing him
fruit and flowers. True, the apples were
green and the sick man could not eat them,
but Bunny and Sue did not know this. The
nurses did not tell them, for they did not want
the children to feel disappointed.</p>

<p>But the flowers were all right to go in the
sick man’s room, and a little later the buttercups,
daisies and dandelions were put in a vase
with water at the stems and placed on the table
near Mr. Pott’s bed.</p>

<p>“Do you children know your way home
alone?” asked Miss Wilson, as she let Bunny
and Sue out of the hospital.</p>

<p>“Yes, thank you,” answered Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>“Shall we come to-morrow and bring Mr.
Pott some more apples and more flowers?”
asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I think not, dear,” the nurse answered.
“You brought him enough apples to
last a week. Though the day after to-morrow,
if you wish, you may bring more flowers. I
think he will like them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll bring two baskets full,” offered
Bunny, swinging in his hand the wood basket,
which had been emptied and given back to
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, one basket will be plenty,” said the
nurse, laughing. “Good-by!”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” echoed Sue.</p>

<p>“We’ll come back day after to-morrow,”
promised Bunny.</p>

<p>But that was not to be, for when that day
came Bunny and his sister had started on their
trip to the rolling ocean.</p>

<p>“Where in the world have you children
been?” asked Mrs. Brown a little later, when
Bunny and Sue walked in the front gate.</p>

<p>“We’ve been to the hospital,” answered
Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Where?” asked his mother, in surprise.</p>

<p>“To the hospital to see Mr. Pott. We took
him some nice apples and buttercups,” explained
Sue.</p>

<p>“Good land!” cried Bunker Blue, who was
working around the yard. “I heard them say
they were going to the hospital,” he told Mrs.
Brown, “but I thought it was only one of their
make-believe games.”</p>

<p>“We truly went to the hospital, and we saw
Mr. Pott,” went on Bunny. “But he talks
funny, so we came away.”</p>

<p>“Of all things!” cried Mrs. Brown. “What
will you two do next? But don’t try to think
up any queer things to do,” she was quick to
say. “I’ve been looking for you to have you
get ready to go with your father and me on
the ocean trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, on the rolling ocean!” cried Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p>“Are we going now?” asked Sue eagerly.
“If we are I must see which of my dolls I’m
going to take.”</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t going now,” answered her
mother, with a smile. “But your father telephoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
a little while ago that we would start
for Philadelphia the day after to-morrow. So
I must get ready sooner than I thought I
would need to. That’s why I was looking for
you children. But I never imagined you had
gone to the hospital. How is Mr. Pott?”</p>

<p>“He’s better,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“He’s worse,” said Bunny. “He kind of
thought I was his lost son, Harry, until he saw
I wasn’t big enough.”</p>

<p>“Poor man,” sighed Mrs. Brown. “I hope
he will find his son.”</p>

<p>“And the treasure,” added Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, and the treasure, too,” said his
mother. “I don’t know what sort of treasure
it is, but I hope he’ll find it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a box of gold, like in the fairy
story,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Or diamonds,” added Bunny. “But,
Mother,” he asked, “why are we going to
Philadelphia? I thought we were going on
the rolling ocean.”</p>

<p>“We are,” answered Mrs. Brown. “But to
get on the ocean we have to go on board a
ship—the <em>Beacon</em>, with Captain Ward in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
charge. And as the <em>Beacon</em> sails from Philadelphia,
we must go to that city to get on
board. So we are going to leave for Philadelphia
day after to-morrow and then the
next day we shall be on the <em>Beacon</em>.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Bunny Brown. “What
fun we’ll have!”</p>

<p>“Lots of fun!” echoed Sue.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was a busy one in
the Brown home, for Mrs. Brown had to look
over and sort the clothes she was to take for
the children. Sue saw her fur coat in her
closet.</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to take that!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” laughed her mother. “Remember
we are going to the West Indies—down
south where it is very warm. You’d
never want to wear fur there.”</p>

<p>“But if we went to the north pole we’d
want fur, shouldn’t we?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“I guess you would,” said his mother, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>The following day was busier than ever in
the Brown home. The family was to start
early the next morning on the train for Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and everything must be in readiness
the night before.</p>

<p>So valises were packed, the trunks were sent
on ahead, and in the afternoon Bunny and Sue
went about saying good-by to their playmates.</p>

<p>“Do alligators grow down in the West Indies?”
asked George Watson of Bunny.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” was the answer. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I wish you’d bring me back one,
if you can,” said George.</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Bunny, though he had
not the least idea in the world how to catch
alligators.</p>

<p>“Just a little one,” added George. “I guess
maybe my mother wouldn’t let me keep a big
one in the house.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring you a little one,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>When Sue went to say good-by to Helen
Newton that little girl said:</p>

<p>“Will you see any orange blossoms down
south, Sue?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Sue answered, for she remembered
having seen those wonderful and
sweetly perfumed flowers when she and
Bunny were in the sunny south the other time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“Please bring me some orange blossoms,”
begged Helen.</p>

<p>“I will,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“You see, one of my dolls is going to be
married,” explained Helen, “and I want the
orange blossoms for her veil.”</p>

<p>“Just like your cousin Louise when she was
married last week!” exclaimed Sue.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Brown paid a visit to
the hospital where Mr. Pott had been taken.</p>

<p>“He’s a very sick man,” said Dr. Rudd.
“He was more badly hurt in his fall from the
horse than I thought at first. But the worst
of it is that he has some worry on his mind.
It’s about his lost son and a missing treasure,
as he calls it. If he could find his son or hear
from him and get back this treasure, he would
get well much more quickly.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he’ll never get either,” said Mr.
Brown. “People lost in a shipwreck are seldom
found again. And since Mr. Pott doesn’t
seem to know where his treasure was lost,
there is no way of finding it for him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Dr. Rudd. “But he’d
get well more quickly if his mind was easier.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Bunny and Sue hardly slept that last night,
so eager were they to start on this trip, and
they were up early in the morning. At the
last minute Bunny dragged out his Christmas
drum and wanted to take that along.</p>

<p>“No, no! You can’t take that!” said his
father.</p>

<p>“I want it to scare alligators with,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“What does the child mean—scare alligators?”
asked his mother.</p>

<p>“I’m going to catch a little alligator for
George Watson,” explained Bunny. “When
I’m catching a little alligator I want to drum
and scare the big ones away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’ll be able to catch any
alligators!” laughed Mr. Brown. “Leave the
drum at home, Bunny. We only have two
small staterooms on the <em>Beacon</em> and there isn’t
much space for drums and things like that.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I take my doll?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, bring your doll,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to take my flashlight,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, anything like that which you can put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
in your pocket is all right,” admitted his
father.</p>

<p>Bunker Blue drove the automobile carrying
the Brown family down to the railroad
station where they were to take an early morning
train to Philadelphia. They had a little
time to wait, and Bunny and Sue ran up and
down the station platform while their father
and mother talked with some friends whom
they met. Finally a long, shrill whistle was
heard.</p>

<p>“Here comes the train,” called Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie! Goodie!” shouted Sue, jumping
up and down.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll soon be on the rolling ocean!”
cried Bunny.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown helped Bunny and Sue up the
steps and then assisted his wife. He carried
the valises into the car which was not so
crowded but what there was room for the
Browns to get two seats near together.</p>

<p>“Good-by! Good-by!” called Mrs. Brown
out of the open window to a number of friends
who had come to bid her good-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“Good-by!” answered the ladies on the platform.</p>

<p>“Hope you have a good time down there,”
called some of Mr. Brown’s friends to him.</p>

<p>“We’ll try,” he replied.</p>

<p>The engineer blew his whistle again and the
train began to pull slowly out of the station.
Mrs. Brown drew her head in from the window
and looked at the seat in front of her
where she had put her little girl and boy. Sue
was there, but Bunny was not!</p>

<p>“Where is Bunny?” asked his mother as the
train began to move faster and faster. “Was
he left behind?”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<span class="fs80">ABOARD THE “BEACON”</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mr. Brown, who had been waving farewell
to some of his friends on the station platform,
turned toward his wife as he heard her
voice and asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Bunny is gone!”</p>

<p>“Gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes! He was in his seat with Sue a moment
ago. He must have got off the train to
see some of his boy friends. Quick, Walter,
go and get him!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown darted for the door, but paused
a moment to ask Sue:</p>

<p>“Did Bunny go out?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see him,” Sue answered.</p>

<p>But then she had been looking out of the
window and would not have noticed what her
brother did. Mr. Brown gave a quick glance
about the car. Bunny was not in sight and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the train was now pulling rapidly out of the
station.</p>

<p>Then a man, who was sitting just behind
Mrs. Brown, said:</p>

<p>“I saw a little boy go out of that door. Perhaps
he may be the one you are looking for.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess he is!” gasped Sue’s
mother. “Bunny is always doing such strange
things!”</p>

<p>By this time Mr. Brown was near the door
leading out to the front platform of that car
in which the Browns were traveling. But before
his father could step outside in came
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Bunny?” cried his
mother.</p>

<p>“Just out on the platform,” he replied.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t go out on the platform
when the train is moving,” chided his father.
“You might be jolted off.”</p>

<p>“The train wasn’t moving when I went out
there,” explained the little boy, as he went to
his seat beside his sister. “I came in as soon
as it began to move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Why did you go outside?” asked Bunny’s
father.</p>

<p>“I wanted to throw away my chewing
gum,” he explained. “I got through with it,
and I thought maybe if I dropped it on the
floor of the car somebody would step on it. So
I went outside to throw it away.”</p>

<p>“Well, that was a right thing to do,” said
Mr. Brown. “But it would have been safer
to have thrown it out of a window. Don’t go
out on the platform again.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I won’t,” promised the little boy.</p>

<p>The excitement was over, and the Browns
began to enjoy the train ride. Of course it
was more fun for Bunny and Sue than it was
for their parents, since the little ones had not
traveled as much as had the older folks.</p>

<p>The ride to Philadelphia took all the morning
and part of the afternoon, but the day was
broken in a very delightful way, for the children,
at least, when they went to the dining
car for lunch.</p>

<p>“I love to eat in a car, don’t you, Bunny?”
whispered Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “It’s fun to see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
trees go whizzing by and the telegraph poles
skip along while you’re eating.”</p>

<p>The travelers reached the Broad street station
in Philadelphia about three o’clock, and
Bunny and Sue looked about them in wonder
at the big train shed into which the engine
pulled them. It was noisy, smoky, and dirty,
and they were glad to get out of it into the
open air. Across the street from the station
was a great building.</p>

<p>“That is the Philadelphia city hall,” explained
Mr. Brown. “On top, though you
can’t see it from here, is a big statue of William
Penn who years ago helped settle Pennsylvania,
which is the state we are now in.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny city hall,” exclaimed
Bunny. “Look, there’s a street going right
under it, and automobiles, too!”</p>

<p>“That’s queer—a street under a building!”
said Sue.</p>

<p>“The city hall is so large that it is built
right over the sidewalk,” explained Mr.
Brown, “and, as you say, Bunny, a street, or
an alley, runs beneath it. Now come around
this way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, look at the pigeons!” cried Bunny as
he ran on ahead around one corner of the
building. Here was a plaza and here and
there were statues of famous men on pedestals.
Flying in the air overhead or flocking down
on the sidewalk to pick up grains and nuts
scattered by bird-lovers were scores of pigeons.
They were so tame that one of them
flew down on a man’s arm and picked grains
of wheat from his open hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they cute!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“I wish I could feed them,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Here you are, children. Give them some
of my grains,” offered the man of whom the
birds did not seem in the least afraid. He
poured into the outstretched palms of Bunny
and Sue some wheat from a bag he carried.
Then, as the children held out their hands,
the pigeons circled around them and one
finally perched on Bunny’s wrist and began
picking up the grains.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I had one!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>A moment later her wish was granted, for
down flew a beautiful white bird and, cooing
away, perched on Sue’s arm. Then, as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
trembled with delight and held out her hand
with the wheat in it, the pigeon began to eat
the grains.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we have been here long
enough,” said Mr. Brown to his wife and children.
“Come! We must go on to the hotel
now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are we going to stay at a hotel?” cried
Bunny, for his pigeon, having eaten all the
grains from the little boy’s hand, had now
flown away.</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall stay at a hotel to-night and
go on board the <em>Beacon</em> in the morning,” explained
Mr. Brown. “It is rather late to go
on her now. As it is, we shall be on board
long enough. I think one more night in a
comfortable big bed will be best for all of
us.”</p>

<p>“Won’t there be any beds on the ship?” Sue
wanted to know. “Do we have to sit up all
night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we’ll go to bed, of course,” said
her mother with a laugh. “But daddy means
on the ship there isn’t as much room as we
have at home or in a hotel. We shall have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
live in small staterooms, and the beds are more
like shelves on the wall than real beds.”</p>

<p>“I know!” cried Bunny. “They’re bunks,
like we slept in when we went to the sugar
camp.”</p>

<p>“Something like that, yes,” agreed his
father.</p>

<p>Having shown the children the city hall,
which was the reason he did not at once take
a taxicab at the station, Mr. Brown now called
one of the swift little autos and soon he and
his family were in a fine hotel on one of the
main streets of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>If they had not been so eager to get on
board the ship, so they might begin voyaging
on the rolling ocean, Bunny and Sue would
have enjoyed their stay at the hotel much
more.</p>

<p>As it was, they liked the place well enough
and thought the big dining room wonderfully
fine, brilliant as it was with lights while soft
music played.</p>

<p>Going back to their own floor, Bunny, walking
along the corridor, saw near the room
where he was to sleep with his father a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
red box with a glass door. Hanging by a
short chain to the box was a little hammer.</p>

<p>“Oh, what’s that?” asked Bunny, pointing
to it. “Is the little hammer there so they can
see who can break the glass first? Let me
try!” he begged, reaching up toward the red
box. “I’ll break it!”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! Don’t touch that!” cried
Bunny’s father, holding him back. “That’s a
fire alarm. There is a hook to pull down,
which makes a bell ring and gives the alarm.
The glass is over the hook so it can’t be so
easily pulled. But in case of fire the glass is
to be broken with the little hammer and the
hook pulled down. We don’t want any fire
alarms now, Bunny.”</p>

<p>“Well, but if there is a fire, can I break the
glass and send in the alarm?” the little boy
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I guess so. Yes, if you see the fire first,”
laughed his father.</p>

<p>“We don’t want any fires, though,” said
Mrs. Brown. “We’ll hope, Bunny, that you’ll
not have a chance to send in the alarm.”</p>

<p>Though feeling a little strange at first in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
their hotel beds, Bunny and Sue at last fell
asleep and did not awaken until their father
and mother called them in the morning.
After breakfast they took another taxicab to
the wharf where the <em>Beacon</em> was tied up.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s a nice ship!” exclaimed Bunny,
getting his first glimpse of the steamer that
was to be their home for several weeks.</p>

<p>“It’s bigger than our play boat,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“And it’s got real water around it!” added
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I should think it would have,” said his
mother. “A big ship like the <em>Beacon</em> couldn’t
very well sail on a grass plot as your pretend
boat sails at home.”</p>

<p>“That water is the Delaware River,” explained
Mr. Brown. “We shall go down the
river in a little while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t we going on the rolling ocean?”
asked Bunny, in disappointed tones.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his father. “The Delaware
River empties into the ocean. We shall
be on the big waves soon enough, don’t
worry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>This pleased the children, and they walked
up the gangplank and on board the <em>Beacon</em>.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you,” said Captain Ward, who
knew Mr. Brown. “I’ll call a steward and
have him take you to your staterooms.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what cute little cabins!” cried Sue, as
she looked in the one where she and her
mother were to sleep.</p>

<p>“Look! There are bunks!” called Bunny,
pointing to the beds fastened one above the
other against the wall.</p>

<p>Then, as the steward was pointing out
places for them to stow away their luggage,
the ship began to tremble and seemed to be
moving.</p>

<p>“Oh, are we going to start so soon?” asked
Mrs. Brown. “Why, our trunks aren’t on
board! Do stop the ship, Walter! Don’t let
it go!”</p>

</div>

<p>Bunny and Sue were excited when they
heard what their mother said about the
ship, and they, too, thought it ought not to be
allowed to start so soon. Mr. Brown looked
at the steward and the man smiled.</p>

<p>“The ship isn’t going yet—not for several
hours,” the steward said. “You will have
plenty of time to get your luggage on board.”</p>

<p>“It feels as if it were going,” remarked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“It’s—now—jiggily like,” Sue said.</p>

<p>“They’re trying the engines,” explained the
steward. “The ship is still fast in the dock,
but the engineer wants to make sure everything
is all right, so he has started the machinery.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said sister Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Then Bunny looked across the stateroom
toward a round opening in the side and said:</p>

<p>“We aren’t moving. I can tell by looking
out of the window.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a good way to make sure—look
from a porthole,” said the steward.</p>

<p>“What’s a porthole?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“That, which Bunny called a window,” explained
her father. “On a ship many things
have different names from those on shore,
though they may be the same.”</p>

<p>“Well, if we aren’t going off without our
trunks it will be all right,” said Mrs. Brown,
with a smile. “Now that we are here we
might as well settle a little, I suppose. Are
we going ashore again?” she asked her husband.</p>

<p>“I think not,” he answered. “How soon do
we start?” he inquired from the steward.</p>

<p>“In about three hours, I think.”</p>

<p>“Then we won’t go ashore,” decided Mrs.
Brown. “I’ll put some more suitable clothes
on Bunny and Sue so they can romp around,
as I know they want to.”</p>

<p>“I’m going down to see the engines!” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Bunny, as his mother opened a valise that contained
his clothes.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to take my doll up and
show her the fishes,” added Sue.</p>

<p>“Better wait a while,” said her father, with
a laugh. “I don’t believe there are any fishes
in this part of the Delaware River, so close
to Philadelphia. As for you going to the engine
room, Bunny, you must wait until I can
go with you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the little boy and girl.
There was plenty to see and do in other places
on the <em>Beacon</em>, they thought.</p>

<p>Going up on deck after they had donned
clothes more suitable for play than those they
had worn on the journey, Bunny and Sue saw
many busy scenes. Men were loading boxes
and barrels into the holds of the ship. Other
men were coming on board, hurrying off, and
then coming back on again. Captain Ward
was upon the bridge, as it is called, a high,
narrow place near the front, or bow, of the
ship, from which the vessel is steered.</p>

<p>There was so much going on that the time
passed very quickly for Bunny and Sue, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
in what seemed about half an hour since they
had come on board they heard shouts of:</p>

<p>“All ashore that’s going ashore!”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Bunny of his
father, pointing to a sailor who was thus calling.</p>

<p>“He means the ship is going to start soon,”
explained Mr. Brown, “and that those who
aren’t sailing on her will have to go on shore
or they will be carried away.”</p>

<p>“Then, in a little while, we’ll be on the rolling
ocean—the rolling ocean!” cried Bunny,
and he walked about the deck with that funny,
heaving motion of his shoulders. “That’s how
it will be when we get on the rolling ocean,”
he explained to his sister.</p>

<p>“Shall I have to walk like that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Bunny.</p>

<p>“Shall I, Daddy?” Sue appealed to her
father.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” he answered, with a laugh.
“Though, of course, when we get out where
the waves are big the ship will not be as calm
and steady as she is now at her dock.”</p>

<p>However, neither Bunny nor Sue thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
long about this, for there was so much else to
take up their attention. They watched and
saw the big hawsers, or ropes that moored the
ship to the pier, cast off. Then the <em>Beacon</em>
trembled and shook again as her big engines
began to work, and, slowly at first, but growing
faster and faster as she gathered speed,
the vessel glided away from the wharf.</p>

<p>“Hurray! Now we’re going!” cried Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p>“Now we’re going!” echoed his sister Sue.</p>

<p>Steaming down the Delaware River, with
Philadelphia on one side and the New Jersey
city of Camden on the other side, is not very
exciting. True, there was plenty to look at,
from the big buildings of Philadelphia on one
hand to the many river boats on the other. So
Bunny and Sue kept their eyes busy.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown found some members of the fish
company, with whom he talked. Mrs. Brown
met some of these men’s wives. One of the
ladies had been in the West Indies before, and
she told Mrs. Brown of the sights to be seen
there.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue, left to themselves, wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
here and there about the deck. Bunny
grew a little impatient, for the ship, moving
down the river, was as steady as a ferryboat
and did not roll as he thought it ought.</p>

<p>In and out among other craft on the river
the <em>Beacon</em> threaded her course, now and then
blowing her big whistle to warn other boats
which way she was going to steer.</p>

<p>“Do you like it here, Sue?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p>“Lots! Don’t you?” replied the little girl.</p>

<p>“Yes. But when we get down on the big
ocean the boat will roll more and I’m going to
catch some fish.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to catch any fish? You
haven’t any pole.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to use a pole,” explained
Bunny. “You just drop your line over the edge
of the boat, like this.”</p>

<p>From his pocket he pulled a ball of cord
which he unwound. Then from the edge of
his blouse he took a pin, which he bent up
until it looked like a fishhook. Bunny tied
the string to the head of the pin, and then he
fastened to the string near the pin a button
which he pulled off his knickerbockers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you shouldn’t have pulled off that button!”
gasped Sue. “Mother won’t like it!”</p>

<p>“It was almost off, anyhow,” explained
Bunny. “It was just hanging by a thread, and
it has to be sewed on, anyhow. I’ll give it to
mother and let her fix it on again. I had to
have something for a weight on my fishline.”</p>

<p>“You can’t catch any fish on a bent-pin
hook,” declared Sue. “I tried it in the brook
at home, and I never caught any fish—’cept
maybe a little, teeny one.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going really to fish with this bent
pin,” Bunny said. “I’m just showing you how
I’m going to do it when we get on the rolling
ocean. Daddy will give me a real hook when
we get there. He didn’t want me to keep one
in my pocket, for it might stick into me.”</p>

<p>“Fishhooks are terribly sticky,” agreed Sue.
“I don’t like ’em much.”</p>

<p>“I do,” declared her brother.</p>

<p>“I guess fish don’t like ’em, either,” went
on Sue.</p>

<p>“Fish have to be caught,” said Bunny. “I
guess the hook doesn’t hurt ’em very much.
But this is how I’m going to fish.”</p>

<p>He dropped his bent-pin hook and button-weighted
line over the rail of the ship from
the upper deck, on which he and Sue had been
looking at the shores of the river on either
side. The string unwound from the ball in
Bunny’s hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly a queer look came over the little
boy’s face. The string tightened in his hand
and when he tried gently to pull the hook and
button up the cord did not move.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“I—I guess I got a bite!” cried Bunny. “I
didn’t think I could catch a fish here with a
bent pin, and I didn’t put any bait on, but I
guess I caught something!”</p>

<p>“Pull up!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“I will,” said Bunny, and he did.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he begun to haul in on
his line than a man’s voice shouted from the
deck below him:</p>

<p>“Hi there! What you doing? Who’s playing
tricks?”</p>

<p>Sue leaned over the rail and looked down.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny Brown,” she cried, with a
laugh, “you’ve caught a man’s hat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“What?” shouted Bunny.</p>

<p>“You caught a man’s hat!” repeated his sister.</p>

<p>Bunny ceased to pull in on his cord and also
leaned over the rail. Caught on his pin was
a sailor’s white hat with its turned-up brim.
And reaching up, trying to get back his hat
which was being lifted away from him, was a
sailor.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” gasped Bunny when he saw
what had happened. “I—I didn’t mean to
do that.”</p>

<p>“All right! I’ll excuse you!” laughed the
sailor. “Lower away now, my lad!”</p>

<p>Bunny did not know exactly what this
meant, but he guessed the sailor wanted him
to let the cord unwind again so the hat
would go down, and this Bunny did. Looking
over the rail, he and Sue saw the sailor
unhook his hat from the bent pin, put the hat
on his head, and then, still laughing, go about
his work.</p>

<p>The dangling hooked pin, weighted by the
button, had caught under the brim of the sailor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
hat as he leaned over near the rail on the
deck below, and Bunny had really made a
catch, though it was not a fish.</p>

<p>“You’d better not try to catch anything
more,” advised Sue.</p>

<p>“I guess I hadn’t,” agreed Bunny, as he
took the pin off the string, wound the latter
back into a ball and put it in his pocket. He
also put the button in his pocket, intending to
ask his mother to sew it on later. The bent
pin he threw away.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue continued to play about the
deck while the <em>Beacon</em> steamed her way down
the Delaware River, toward Delaware Bay,
whence she would get into the Atlantic Ocean.
After a while the children decided to play
hide-and-seek, and Bunny said he would hide
first.</p>

<p>Sue covered her eyes and began to count so
as to give her brother a chance to find a good
hiding place. And at last, having waited as
long as she thought was proper, Sue called:</p>

<p>“Ready or not, I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Opening her eyes, she began to search for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Bunny. There were many places where he
might hide, new and strange places on the
deck of the steamer.</p>

<p>Sue looked in many of these without finding
Bunny. She was going to “give up” when,
as she was standing near a big coil of rope,
she heard what sounded like a sneeze half
held back.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Sue. Standing on her tiptoes
she looked over and down into the coil of
rope, which was hollow and shaped like a
small barrel. There, crouched down inside
the coil of rope, was Bunny!</p>

<p>“Tit-tat, Bunny!” cried Sue, running to
touch “home,” which was a deck ventilator.</p>

<p>“Ho! you wouldn’t have found me if I
hadn’t sneezed,” said Bunny as he climbed out
of the pile of rope.</p>

<p>“No, I guess I wouldn’t,” agreed Sue. “It
was a good place to hide. Now it’s my turn.”</p>

<p>When Bunny “blinded” Sue crept softly
away and then, circling back, she hid behind
the very ventilator where Bunny was standing.
The ventilator was like a big pipe, and
it completely hid little Sue. So when Bunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
walked away, thinking his sister was perhaps
hiding in the same coil of rope where he had
been, Sue darted out, touched “home,” and
cried:</p>

<p>“In free! In free!”</p>

<p>She had beaten Bunny at his own game.</p>

<p>The children played hide-and-seek until it
was time for lunch, and after lunch they had
more fun. Then their mother, knowing they
must be tired, having arisen early to start
traveling, said:</p>

<p>“I think you had better go to your bunks
and lie down for a nap, you two.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t want to go to bed in the daytime!”
objected Bunny.</p>

<p>“I don’t either, but maybe my doll does,”
said Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, Sue, you lie down with your doll,”
suggested Mrs. Brown. And when Sue had
done this she soon fell asleep. A little later
Bunny, having no one with whom to play,
went to the stateroom he shared with his
father, and soon he was asleep.</p>

<p>When Bunny and Sue awakened some hours
later they noticed a peculiar motion to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
ship. No longer did she sail along calmly and
steadily, but swayed up and down, rolling
from side to side.</p>

<p>“Where are we? What’s happened?”
Bunny asked his father, who was in the stateroom.</p>

<p>“Come up on deck and see,” was the answer.</p>

<p>It was getting dark when Bunny and his
father reached the deck, but it was light
enough to see that they were no longer in the
river. They were out on big, wide, open
water.</p>

<p>“Is this the ocean?” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is the rolling ocean,” his father
said.</p>

<p>Just then the ship gave such a roll that
Bunny would have fallen had not his father
caught hold of him.</p>

<span class="fs80">SUE IN THE CELLAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Bunny Brown, as he steadied
himself against his father’s legs and gazed
off over the tumbling waves, “I guess this is
the rolling ocean.”</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Sure, I like it,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Does it make you feel sick?” went on Bunny’s
father.</p>

<p>“Sick? No,” answered the little boy.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t be afraid if you feel a little
ill,” went on Mr. Brown. “Sometimes the
rolling ocean makes people sick, but they soon
get over it.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to be sick,” declared Bunny.</p>

<p>“Maybe I am,” announced Sue hopefully.
She had just come up on deck with her
mother. “I feel sort of dizzy like.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I exactly like this rolling
ocean,” remarked Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“Then you had better go below and lie
down,” advised her husband. “Supper will
soon be ready.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m going to care for any,”
said Mrs. Brown in a low voice.</p>

<p>That night Sue’s mother was made a trifle
ill by the heaving, rocking motion of the <em>Beacon</em>
as the ship got farther and farther out
on the rolling ocean. She did not want to eat
anything, and the next day she was still sick.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue, however, did not seem to
mind the strange motion, and they braved it
out with their father, who was not subject to
seasickness. Toward the end of the day Mrs.
Brown was feeling better. That is a way seasickness
has. At first it makes you very ill indeed,
and you think you are never going to
get better. But it passes and you feel fine
again.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Brown,” said Captain Ward, as
he came into the dining cabin for the evening
meal and saw the family at one of the tables,
“have your folks found their sea legs yet?”</p>

<p>“Just about getting them on,” laughed Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“That’s good. Well, things are going to be
better from now on, I think. And we’ll soon
be in very pleasant waters.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean about finding our sea
legs?” whispered Sue to her mother. “I have
the same legs I had, haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Captain Ward means that you are over
being seasick,” explained Mr. Brown. “The
sailors say, when that happens, that a person
has found his ‘sea legs’—that is, he can go
about the heaving decks without feeling ill.”</p>

<p>“I feel fine!” cried Bunny Brown. “I’m
going to fish to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t catch any more of my sailors’
hats!” laughed Captain Ward as he took his
place at the table.</p>

<p>Bunny wondered for a moment how the
captain knew about the accident with the
string and the bent pin, but then he guessed
that one of the crew told the others and so the
story got around.</p>

<p>“You’ll be careful, will you, Bunny?” asked
the captain, playfully shaking his finger at the
little boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I’ll be careful,” he promised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>Bunny asked his father for a real hook to
fasten on the piece of cord, but Mr. Brown
told the little fellow that it would be hard to
catch fish on the simple cord.</p>

<p>“To get fish from a fast-moving steamer,
Bunny,” said Mr. Brown, “you must have a
very long line that will go away out beyond
the propeller, and such a line must be very
strong. Then, too, since it is pulled through
the water very fast, there is not much chance
for a fish to take the bait. Better wait until
we anchor, and then it will be easier to
fish.”</p>

<p>So Bunny, knowing his father’s advice was
good, gave up the idea of trying to catch fish
for the family dinner and found something
else with which to amuse himself on the ship.
There was plenty to do, and more to see, so
he and Sue were not lonesome, though they
could not run around as much nor roam as
far as they could in the woods and fields at
home.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Pott was here with us,” said Sue
to Bunny that afternoon when they had finished
playing a game of tag, “maybe he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
find his ship with his son Harry on it and the
treasure.”</p>

<p>“No, he couldn’t find it,” decided Bunny,
after thinking it over.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Sue asked.</p>

<p>“Because the <em>Mary Bell</em> was sunk,” said
Bunny. “It went down in the ocean. So how
could Mr. Pott find it, even if he was here—and
he isn’t here?”</p>

<p>“I know he isn’t here,” said Sue. “But he
could be here if they would let him out of the
hospital. Maybe there’s a little piece of his
ship that didn’t sink, and he could find that.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted Bunny. “But even if
there was a little piece of his schooner left, it
wouldn’t be big enough for his son to be on it,
nor the treasure.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” agreed Sue. “I wonder if
anybody will take Mr. Pott some more flowers
and apples, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“I guess maybe they will,” he said.</p>

<p>A little while after that, as Bunny was
watching one of the sailors splice, or mend, a
rope on deck, Sue thought she would go to
the stateroom and get her doll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>“I guess my doll needs some sea air,” said
the little girl to herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was lying down in the stateroom,
half asleep, when Sue entered softly to
get the doll.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, my dear?” asked
Mrs. Brown drowsily.</p>

<p>“I’m going up on deck with my doll,” answered
the little girl.</p>

<p>“Is Bunny with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother, he’s up on deck. So is
daddy.”</p>

<p>“All right. Be careful going up and down
the stairs.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Sue.</p>

<p>Sue meant to be careful, but instead of going
upstairs, or up one of the companionways,
as stairs are usually called on a vessel, Sue
started down.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was thinking too much about
the sea air her doll was going to breathe, or
perhaps she was thinking too much about poor
Mr. Pott. At any rate, Sue went down instead
of up. She went down and down and at last
she found herself in a dim part of the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
where only a little electric light here and there
gave an uncertain glow.</p>

<p>Then Sue realized that she had gone wrong.
She looked about her, clutched her doll tightly
under her arm, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I’m down cellar!”</p>

<p>In a way, she was in the “cellar,” or hold,
of the ship.</p>

<p>As Sue looked about her in the dimness she
heard a noise. Then in the glow of one electric
light she saw a black man coming toward
her. The man was very big, bigger, Sue
thought, than anybody she had ever seen.</p>

</div>

<p>Sue Brown was very seldom afraid of anything.
She and Bunny had gone through so
many strange adventures and nothing had
happened to them—that is, nothing of any account—that
Sue was inclined to believe that
nothing ever would happen. She had been
lost more than once, and she had appealed to
all sorts of persons—even tramps—to help her
find her way home, and she had always
reached home.</p>

<p>“And I guess I’m lost now down here in the
cellar of this ship,” thought Sue. “Maybe
this is a tramp to tell me how to get upstairs
again.”</p>

<p>Sue spoke of things on the ship as she would
of things at home—“down cellar and upstairs.”</p>

<p>The big, black man came nearer and nearer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
and as he passed beneath an electric light Sue
could see that he was not a negro, which she
had at first taken him to be. He was black
from coal dust that covered his face, hands,
and clothes.</p>

<p>“Hello, little girl!” called the big man, and
his voice was very friendly. “What are you
doing down in the stoke hold?”</p>

<p>“Is this the stoke hold?” asked Sue. “I
thought it was the cellar.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the man. “Well, it is
like a cellar, isn’t it, little girl? But what are
you doing down here?”</p>

<p>“I—now—I guess I’m lost,” replied Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re lost, then I’ve found you,”
said the man, his eyes looking strange in his
black face. “You’re one of the passengers, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sue, “Bunny and I are going to
the West Indies, and maybe we’ll find Mr.
Pott’s lost son and the treasure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So you’re treasure-hunters, are
you, you and your brother? But is this Mr.
Pott on board?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s in the hospital back in Bellemere,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
explained Sue. “He’s a sailor and he
fell off a horse.”</p>

<p>“A sailor has no business on a horse,” said
the big man. “But I guess I’d better not be
keeping you down here talking. Your folks
may be looking for you, thinking you are
lost.”</p>

<p>“Yes, please, I wish you’d take me upstairs,”
Sue said. “I don’t think I could find
my way myself. I came down a lot of stairs.
I forgot—I should have gone up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, down in the stoke hold is no place for
little girls,” said the man.</p>

<p>He was close to Sue now, and she could see
the thick, black dust on his hands and face.
He looked like the coal men who put the winter’s
supply of “black diamonds” in the Brown
cellar, so Sue asked:</p>

<p>“Do you work in a coal bin?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly,” the man answered. “I’m
what they call a coal-passer. I bring the coal
from the bins, or holds, to the furnace room,
a wheelbarrow load at a time. I guess I’m
pretty black,” he concluded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sue, simply but honestly, “you
are black, but I don’t mind that—it will wash
off. You’re big too, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Hum! I’m glad you aren’t afraid of me,”
laughed the man. “But sometimes I think the
coal dust will never wash off after my day’s
work. It would be too bad if I had to stay
black, wouldn’t it—especially when there’s so
much of me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sue, “it would. And now,
please, will you take me upstairs?”</p>

<p>“That I will,” replied the coal-passer. “At
least I’ll take you to the foot of the stairs that
lead up to the berth deck, and you can find
your way from there, or some of the stewards
will show you. We stokers aren’t allowed
to come up on deck until we get clean,
and I haven’t time for that now. Come along
with me, little girl.”</p>

<p>Sue followed, and went up several flights
of steps behind the man, who watched that she
did not fall, for some of the steps were of iron
and slippery.</p>

<p>At last her guide stopped and told Sue to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
straight ahead and toward a light which he
pointed out, and then up another flight of
stairs.</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right then,” said the stoker.</p>

<p>“Good-by, and thank you,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” echoed the man, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He disappeared down a dark stairway,
merging into the blackness of which he
seemed a part, and Sue, going up another
flight of steps, found herself in a place she remembered
as being not far from her mother’s
stateroom. A deck steward, clean and neat in
white trousers and a blue coat, saw the little
girl and asked:</p>

<p>“Where have you been? Your mother and
father have been looking for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been down cellar,” explained Sue simply.
“But I like it upstairs much better.”</p>

<p>“I should think you might!” laughed the
steward. “I guess, little miss, you’ve been
down in the stoke hold.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s where I was,” admitted Sue,
“and a nice, big, black, coal man showed me
the way back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown came along just then, somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
worried over Sue’s absence, and took her to
her mother’s room.</p>

<p>Soon after Sue had left her mother lying
down in the stateroom Mr. Brown had come
below to see his wife. He said Sue had not
come back to the deck where he and Bunny
had been waiting, and when Mrs. Brown related
that Sue had left her some time before,
there was a worrisome time until the little girl
appeared.</p>

<p>“Don’t wander away like that again,”
chided her mother.</p>

<p>“No’m, I won’t,” promised Sue.</p>

<p>The excitement over, Sue went up on deck
with her doll, and after a while she announced
that the doll was asleep.</p>

<p>“How can she be asleep when her eyes are
open?” Bunny wanted to know. “She isn’t
asleep at all!”</p>

<p>“She is so!” declared Sue.</p>

<p>“But how can she be with her eyes open?”
asked the little boy. “You don’t sleep with
your eyes open, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t; but my doll does,” declared
Sue. “She’s different! She used to close her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
eyes when she went to sleep, but something
broke in her and now she doesn’t close them.
She sleeps with her eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a funny way to sleep,” remarked
Bunny. “Anyhow, if she is asleep, let’s play
ring-toss.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p>This is a game often played on shipboard.
On the deck is set up a short wooden pin, or
pole. Each player is given several rings of
rope, some large and some small.</p>

<p>Standing a short distance away from the
pin, each player tries to toss all his or her rope
rings over the little pole. The one who tosses
the largest number of rings over the pin wins
the game.</p>

<p>Some of the men and women passengers
played this game, but just now the rings were
not in use, and Bunny and Sue took them.
They placed the pin, set in its wooden base,
on the deck near a companionway and began
to toss the rings.</p>

<p>Whether Sue was more skillful or more
lucky than Bunny may be guessed at, but she
certainly tossed more rings over the pin than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
did her brother. This made Bunny try all the
harder.</p>

<p>“Here goes one over!” he cried, tossing a
ring as hard as he could.</p>

<p>He did not throw it straight and it went too
high. In fact, it went toward the stairway instead
of toward the pin. And just then his
father came up the stairs.</p>

<p>As if Bunny had aimed it, the rope ring,
one of the largest, shot straight for Mr.
Brown and settled down over his head and
around his neck.</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Mr. Brown in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny Brown, look what you did!”
shouted Sue.</p>

<p>“I ringed daddy! I ringed daddy!”
laughed Bunny. “I’m a good shot! I ringed
daddy!”</p>

<p>“I should say you did!” chuckled his father.
“But I don’t call it a very straight shot when
you were aiming for the peg over there. Just
for that you don’t get any lollypop!”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you got lollypops?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t any,” said Mr. Brown, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
a laugh. “But if I had any you would get
only a half one, for making such a poor shot,
and Sue would get two.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bunny, I’d give you some of my
lollypops,” said Sue kindly. “Only I haven’t
got any,” she added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“We can get some when we get to the West
Indies,” said Bunny. “When will the boat be
there, Daddy?” he asked, as Mr. Brown, taking
the rope ring from his neck, sent it with a
skillful toss over the pin.</p>

<p>“Oh, in about a week now, I guess,” was
the answer. “You see we aren’t as fast as a
regular passenger steamer. We are taking our
time going south.”</p>

<p>“It’s lots of fun,” said Bunny. “I like it.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said his sister Sue.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown played at ring-toss with the
children for a while, and the rest of the day
was spent in walking about deck, looking at
distant ships, or in playing other games.
Bunny and Sue managed to keep busy, so
when night came they were tired, sleepy and
ready for bed.</p>

<p>That night, after the children were asleep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Mr. and Mrs. Brown sat up a little while,
talking in one of the saloons before retiring.
They spoke of Mr. Pott, wondering how he
was getting along in the hospital.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Mr. Brown
and Mrs. Brown went to their staterooms.</p>

<p>How long Mrs. Brown had been asleep she
did not know, but she was suddenly awakened
by feeling the ship quiver and shake as if it
had struck something in the water. Sue was
also awakened.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mother?” asked the little girl.
“Are we going to sink?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Mrs. Brown answered.</p>

<p>Then throughout the <em>Beacon</em> was heard the
sound of confused voices and the shouts of a
midnight alarm.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">OVERBOARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Brown quickly arose and put on a
dressing gown and slippers and helped Sue
out of her berth.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Mother?”
asked Sue sleepily.</p>

<p>“We must get ready for whatever is going
to happen,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Though Mrs. Brown did not tell her little
girl so, she thought that something had happened
to the ship and that perhaps the passengers
and crew might have to get into the lifeboats
and row away.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Brown heard her husband and
Bunny moving about in their stateroom across
the corridor, and she heard Bunny ask:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“I guess we bumped into a whale,” said Mr.
Brown, not because he really believed this but
in order not to frighten his little boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>And it proved to be the best answer that
could have been made, for Bunny laughed
and said:</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! I guess if our ship hit a whale
it would make his head ache, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think it would,” replied Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>By this time he, also, had on a dressing
gown and slippers and had opened his stateroom
door. At the same time Mrs. Brown
opened hers.</p>

<p>“What happened?” she asked.</p>

<p>“We struck something,” said Mr. Brown.
“But it doesn’t seem to be anything serious.
Things are quieting down.”</p>

<p>This was true. The <em>Beacon</em> had come to a
stop on the rolling ocean, and though she
rolled a bit herself she seemed to be in no
danger. The noise of the shouting and talking
also died away.</p>

<p>One of the stewards came through the corridor
and spoke to several of the passengers
who had their heads thrust out of their partly
opened stateroom doors.</p>

<p>“There is no danger—no danger at all,” the
steward said. “You may all go back to bed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Captain Ward thinks we struck a derelict,”
was the answer. “Whatever it was, we
hit it a glancing blow. The ship has suffered
no damage and we are going on again directly.
Probably it was only a small derelict
we hit.”</p>

<p>This satisfied the passengers and they closed
their doors. But Bunny Brown wanted to
know something, so he asked his father:</p>

<p>“Is a derelict a whale, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s a wrecked ship floating about in
the water, sunk so low that you can hardly
see it,” was the answer. “It drifts about, and,
not being seen, derelicts are often struck by
other ships.”</p>

<p>“Does it hurt the derelict?” asked Bunny,
while his mother and sister listened to the
talk.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t hurt a derelict,” was Mr.
Brown’s reply. “But sometimes a derelict,
especially if it’s a big sunken ship, will damage
the other vessel. But I guess we’re all
right.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. When morning came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
there was no sign of the floating wreck, if such
it was that the <em>Beacon</em> had bumped into. Nor
was the steamer harmed. She proceeded on
her course after a short stop following the
midnight alarm.</p>

<p>Up to this time the days had been bright
and sunny for Bunny Brown and his sister
Sue. But on the morning after the bump in
the night the sun was hidden behind masses
of dark clouds. When Bunny saw Captain
Ward gazing around the horizon, where sky
and water seem to meet, and when the little
boy heard the commander tell his officers to
see that everything was made “snug and
tight,” Bunny went to his father.</p>

<p>“Are we going to have a storm?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Mr. Brown. “But that’s
nothing. We must have storms once in a
while. We can’t have the sun always.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” agreed Bunny.</p>

<p>“Will it be a snowstorm?” Sue wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“I should say not!” laughed her father.
“Can’t you feel how much warmer the
weather is getting?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, it is warmer,” said Sue. That very
day she had asked her mother to let her wear
a thinner dress, which Mrs. Brown had agreed
to. “It’s quite warm,” Sue said.</p>

<p>“That shows we are going farther and farther
south each day,” said Mr. Brown. “And
they never have snow or ice down in the West
Indies.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have a rainstorm,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, if we have any kind of a storm, it will
be rain,” his father said.</p>

<p>“And wind?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there is likely to be wind,” admitted
Mr. Brown. “But the <em>Beacon</em> is a stout
ship. She will come through the storm all
right.”</p>

<p>In spite of this, as Bunny and Sue saw the
clouds grow blacker and blacker and as they
noticed the sailors going about the decks, making
fast anything that was loose enough to
blow away, the children became a little
alarmed.</p>

<p>To quiet them, Mr. Brown took them down
to see the big engines at work. Bunny liked
machinery, and he was interested. When Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Brown pointed out how strong the machinery
was and how it pushed the ship along through
the water, the children concluded that a storm
at sea need not alarm them.</p>

<p>But toward noon the wind began to blow
and the ship began to pitch and toss in the big
waves. Then Bunny and his sister did not
like it so much. Nor did Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, this won’t amount to anything,” said
Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>But the storm was worse than Mr. Brown
would admit, even to himself, and the <em>Beacon</em>
continued to roll and toss in the heavy “seas,”
as sailors call the big waves.</p>

<p>Once, when Bunny and Sue were down in
their staterooms with Mrs. Brown, changing
their clothes, for the salty spray had wet them,
the ship gave such a sudden lurch that Sue
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re going to tip over!”</p>

<p>And even Mrs. Brown feared this for a moment.</p>

<p>Bunny heard what his sister said and cried:</p>

<p>“If we turn over we’ll stand on our heads!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like standing on my head,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Sue. “And I don’t want the ship to
turn over.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I! My gracious, I should say
not!” exclaimed Mrs. Brown. “Please don’t
even talk about such a terrible happening, my
dears!” Then Bunny saw how serious his
mother was.</p>

<p>Really, for a time it seemed as if something
might happen to the <em>Beacon</em>. She was in the
very midst of a sudden, tropical hurricane
which splashed the waves big and high and
made the ship lean far over to one side.</p>

<p>But Captain Ward and his men were skillful
sailors, and they managed the vessel so
that she turned back again, and was on what
is called an even keel, riding so that her decks
were straight instead of slanting.</p>

<p>Still the wind blew hard and the seas ran
high, though there was not as much danger as
at first. After a while Bunny and Sue grew
so accustomed to the storm and the rolling and
pitching and tossing of the ship that they began
to think it was rather fun.</p>

<p>“Could we go up on deck and look at the
big waves?” begged Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed!” answered his mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, just a little look!” pleaded the boy.</p>

<p>“I might take him and Sue up to the head
of the companionway and let them look out
for a minute,” said Mr. Brown. “It really is
a sight worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you think it will be all right, go
ahead,” said his wife. “But be careful.”</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Bunny.</p>

<p>“And don’t let the waves wash me overboard,”
begged Sue.</p>

<p>“I’ll hold you tight,” said her father.</p>

<p>On the advice of one of the stewards, they
went up to a sheltered spot where they could
get a view of the deck and the big waves but
where they would be sheltered from the worst
of the gale. Standing there in the lee of a
deckhouse, Bunny and Sue looked out on the
tumbling and foam-flecked waves.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to fall in them,” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Sue.</p>

<p>Just then the wind began to blow more
fiercely than before. The ship trembled under
the blast and a big wave washed up on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
deck, some of the spray splashing on the children.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, Sue set up a cry:</p>

<p>“She’s gone! She fell overboard! Oh,
Elizabeth was washed overboard by the
wave!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">BUNNY IS LOCKED IN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nothing causes more excitement on board
a ship than the cry of “man overboard!” Of
course, Sue did not say a man was overboard.
She called out about some one named “Elizabeth.”
As the little girl clung to her father
she sobbed aloud and repeated over and over
again:</p>

<p>“Elizabeth will be drowned! Elizabeth
will be drowned!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown did not know what to make of
it. He knew that he and his two children
were the only people standing near the deckhouse
where they could watch the big waves.
He knew there had been no little girl named
Elizabeth near them. Yet Sue had cried out
that Elizabeth had gone overboard.</p>

<p>“Did you see some little girl washed over
the rail by the wave?” asked Mr. Brown.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
He thought perhaps some of the other passengers
might have had a little girl named Elizabeth—though,
if so, why he had not seen her
playing with Sue he could not imagine—and
that she had been standing near the rail and
had been washed away.</p>

<p>Whether Sue did not hear her father’s question
because of the roar of the storm or
whether she was crying too hard to answer,
does not much matter, for a moment later some
sailors who were on deck and who heard the
little girl’s sobbing cry shouted:</p>

<p>“Man overboard! Lower a boat! Man
overboard!”</p>

<p>Of course there was not a man overboard.
Sue had spoken of “Elizabeth.” But on a
ship, no matter who falls into the water,
whether a man, a woman, or a child, the cry
of alarm is always the same: “Man overboard!”</p>

<p>Sailors know and understand that warning
better than any other.</p>

<p>But before a boat could be lowered or even
some of the cork life-rings tossed over the rail,
another big wave came up and washed across
the decks. On the crest of this wave something
white fluttered.</p>

<p>“That looks like a little girl’s skirts!”
thought Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Then the wave broke some distance away
from where he and the children were standing,
and the fluttering white object came washing
up along the deck and straight for Sue.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s Elizabeth! She came back to
me!” cried the little girl. “Elizabeth went
overboard, but she isn’t drowned!”</p>

<p>Then she made a grab for and picked up—her
big doll!</p>

<p>The sailors who had been getting ready to
lower the boat and toss out life-rings looked
in wonder at Sue clasping the wet and soaking
doll. But Sue was happy—she did not care.</p>

<p>“Well, shiver my timbers!” cried one of the
men as he shook the salty spray from his face.
“I thought she meant a little girl was overboard!”</p>

<p>“So did I,” said another.</p>

<p>“Sue,” said her father a bit sternly, “whom
did you mean when you said Elizabeth went
overboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Elizabeth! My doll, of course!” answered
Sue. “Here she is. Elizabeth is my
best doll. I brought her up to look at the
storm and a wave washed her away.”</p>

<p>“And another wave washed her back
again!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” agreed Sue.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, that is just what had
happened. Of course it was only the crest, or
top part, of the wave that had come aboard,
snatched Sue’s doll out of her hands and carried
it away. If the whole, big wave had
come aboard there might have been no Bunny
Brown and his sister Sue left.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have cried out that way
about just a doll,” said Sue’s father, as he led
the children back to the sheltered cabin. “The
men thought you meant a real child.”</p>

<p>“Well, Elizabeth is real,” declared Sue.
“She’s a real doll and she’s my child.” And
nothing Mr. or Mrs. Brown could say would
make Sue believe she had done anything
wrong.</p>

<p>Later Mr. Brown told the sailors how sorry
he was that his little girl had caused them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
such a fright, making them think a real child
had gone over the rail.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t mind that,” laughed one of
the men. “We’re only too glad to know it was
only a doll and that the little girl has it back
again.”</p>

<p>Though Sue had her doll, the salt water
had spoiled some of the clothes. But Elizabeth’s
little mistress did not mind, for she said
they were going to the West Indies where it
would be so warm that Elizabeth would need
few clothes.</p>

<p>The storm raged all the remainder of that
day and far into the night. But when morning
dawned the wind went down and the rain
ceased, though the waves were still high and
would be for another day or so. Big storms
at sea do not pass as quickly as they do on
shore, for the ocean keeps up its restless, heaving
motion.</p>

<p>The <em>Beacon</em> came out of the hurricane with
little damage as far as could be seen. Though
later Captain Ward blamed the storm for
something very strange and serious that happened.
That is, it was serious for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>With the ceasing of the storm, Bunny and
Sue were allowed to go out on deck the next
day. They both enjoyed this, for it was no
fun to be “cooped up,” as Bunny called it, in
one of the cabins. The staterooms where the
Brown family slept were too small to sit in
except for a few minutes, so when they wanted
to talk or when the children wanted to play
games they did so in one of the larger cabins,
or saloons, as they are called.</p>

<p>Every hour it seemed to be getting warmer,
now that the <em>Beacon</em> was getting well into the
south. The wind that blew across her decks
was as balmy as the hot breezes of summer,
though this was only early spring, or had been
when Bunny and Sue left Bellemere.</p>

<p>“It’s always summer in the south, isn’t it,
Daddy?” asked Sue of her father when she
and her brother were talking about the warm
weather.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, it is if you go far enough
south,” he said. “They don’t have winter in
the far south, but they have what is called the
rainy season, and that at times is worse than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
our winter, though it is never cold. But it is
very wet—raining every day for months, some
times more than once a day.”</p>

<p>“You’d have to carry an umbrella all the
while, wouldn’t you?” inquired Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes. And rubber boots, too,” his father
answered.</p>

<p>“And maybe a rubber coat,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, a rubber coat would be too warm,”
said her father. “But I don’t believe we shall
have much rain, as this isn’t the season for it
down here.”</p>

<p>That afternoon Bunny tried to get Sue to
come up on deck and play another game of
toss with the rope rings. But Sue said:</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a new dress for Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” sighed Bunny.</p>

<p>He wished Sue would play with him, but as
she would not he wandered into the dining
saloon. One of the stewards was setting the
tables, getting ready for the evening meal,
though the time for eating was some hours off.</p>

<p>Bunny looked at the white tablecloths, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
sparkling silver and glasses. Seeing the tables
being made ready, made the little boy think
that he was hungry.</p>

<p>If Bunny had been at home he would have
gone to the kitchen to ask Julia for some
crackers or a piece of cake, and he did not see
any reason why he should not ask this steward
for something. So Bunny did it, very delicately,
by saying:</p>

<p>“Do you ever have any crackers?”</p>

<p>“You mean, do I ever eat any biscuits?”
asked the steward, with a smile.</p>

<p>“No, I mean crackers! And I mean do you
ever give hungry boys some?” went on Bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean!” laughed the
man. “We call them biscuits in England
where I came from. But over here, in the
States, I believe they call them crackers. So
you want a biscuit, my little man?”</p>

<p>“I’d like some crackers, yes, thank you,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, the pantry steward, Mr. Jobson, is
getting out some sweet cakes and biscuits for
dinner this evening. He is in number two
storeroom, down that passage,” and the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
pointed. “If you go there and ask him, I’m
quite sure he’ll give you a cake of some sort.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Bunny. “I’ll go ask
him.”</p>

<p>The steward who was setting the tables
pointed out the way Bunny was to go—first to
the end of the passage, then down a flight of
steps, and then he would find himself in the
storeroom corridor. He was to walk along
that until he saw an open door. This would
be storeroom number two and Mr. Jobson
would be in there.</p>

<p>Thanking his new friend again, Bunny set
off. He went first to tell Sue he would get
her a cookie. Then he found his way to the
storeroom corridor and proceeded along a
somewhat darkened passage until he saw light
streaming out from an open door.</p>

<p>Bunny reached this open door and looked
in. He could see on the shelves many cans of
food and packages of crackers and cakes. But
he saw nothing of Mr. Jobson.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s inside, farther back,” thought
Bunny. “I’ll go in and ask him for a cookie.
I’ll get one for Sue, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>Stepping within the room, in which a single
electric light was burning, Bunny called:</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Jobson! Will you please give
me some cookies?”</p>

<p>There was no answer, and, thinking he had
not made himself heard, Bunny stepped farther
into the room and toward the back.
Again he called.</p>

<p>Presently he heard a sliding noise and he
turned in time to see the door by which he had
entered closing. It ran along a brass rail and
snapped shut with a click.</p>

<p>“I guess it locked itself!” exclaimed Bunny.
“I’m locked in! But I guess Mr. Jobson can
get me out! Hello, Mr. Jobson!” he called.
“The door slammed shut and locked itself.
Will you please open it and give me a
cookie?”</p>

<p>No one answered Bunny Brown.</p>

<span class="fs80">A TERRIBLE NOISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The <em>Beacon</em> steamed on, each hour taking
her nearer and nearer to the warm, sunny
southland of the West Indies. But Bunny
Brown, locked in the storeroom, cared nothing
for this. All he wanted was to be let out.
He had even forgotten about the cookie now.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown were up on deck, sitting
in easy chairs and enjoying the beautiful
sight of the ocean, which, though it was rolling
a bit, was not as wild as it had been during
the storm.</p>

<p>Sue came up to her father and mother, carrying
her doll Elizabeth, for whom she had
made a new dress out of an old towel her
mother had given her for this purpose. The
sewing Sue did was not very good—the
stitches were much too large.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Elizabeth’s dress nice?” asked Sue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
showing her mother the new gown for the
doll.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is a pretty dress,” replied Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>“Where is Bunny?” asked Mr. Brown, for
usually the little boy and his sister were together.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny didn’t want to play doll with
me, so he went to get something to eat,” explained
Sue. “I guess Bunny’s going to play
picnic,” added Sue.</p>

<p>“Where would he get anything to eat on
this ship?” asked Mrs. Brown. “He can’t go
to the kitchen as he could if he were at home.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he will ask one of the dining-room
or pantry stewards to get him something,”
suggested Mr. Brown. “They’ll be
glad to do that. But it will not be wise for
Bunny to eat much now. It is too near the
time for the regular meal.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t worry him,” laughed Mrs.
Brown. “Bunny always has a good appetite.”</p>

<p>So, thinking their little boy was in the care
of one of the stewards, Mr. and Mrs. Brown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
did not worry about him. They remained on
deck for some time longer. Sue stayed with
them, playing with her doll.</p>

<p>Then came the bugle call, which served the
same purpose as a dinner bell at home. One
of the sailors blew several musical notes on a
horn, and this meant that the passengers, the
captain, and such of the ship’s officers as were
not on duty could get their meal.</p>

<p>“I guess Bunny is down there waiting for
us,” said Mr. Brown, as he started for the dining
saloon with his wife and Sue.</p>

<p>Much to the surprise of his father and
mother, Bunny was not waiting for them in
the dining saloon. The tables were set and
many of the passengers were in their chairs.
But at the table assigned to the Brown family
there was no Bunny.</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he went up on deck to find us,”
suggested her husband. “He may have gone
up by a different stairway, and we didn’t see
him. I’ll go and look. You sit down with
Sue, my dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Brown sat down at the table to wait
for her husband’s return. But when he came
down a little later he was alone.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bunny?” asked Mrs. Brown, now
anxious.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t up there on deck, and no one
seems to have seen him around lately,” was the
answer. “I think he must have wandered into
some other part of the ship. Perhaps he has
gone down to the engine room. The last time
I took him there he asked to go again, and I
said I’d see about it. He may have gone there
by himself.”</p>

<p>“I hope nothing has happened to him!” exclaimed
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Nothing has, I’m sure,” her husband said.
“But I’ll have a search made at once.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to start his meal, Mr.
Brown spoke to some of the officers, and at
once a search was started through the ship to
find the missing boy.</p>

<p>All this while poor Bunny was securely
locked in the storeroom where many good
things to eat were kept.</p>

<p>At first, after Bunny realized that the swaying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
of the ship had made the sliding door roll
shut and lock, he thought perhaps he could
push it open again and get out. So, after calling
once or twice for Mr. Jobson, the pantry
steward, and getting no answer, Bunny went
to the door and began to push on it.</p>

<p>But, as far as Bunny could tell, the door
was made to open only from the outside,
though, he thought, perhaps a man if he knew
how could have opened it from within. There
seemed to be some sort of catch that held it
shut, and push and pull though he did, Bunny
could not stir it.</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Jobson is away back in there
and doesn’t hear me calling,” said Bunny to
himself, after he had worked in vain at the
door for some time. “I’ll go and look.”</p>

<p>The pantry was small and well lighted by
even the one electric bulb, so Bunny could
easily see his way to the back part. When he
got there he did not find the cupboard bare, as
Mother Hubbard did, for there was plenty to
eat in this ship’s pantry, but Mr. Jobson was
not in the storeroom.</p>

<p>Then Bunny Brown knew he was locked in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
all alone, and for the first time he felt a bit
frightened.</p>

<p>But he was also a bit hungry, and seeing on
a shelf a package of ginger cookies that had
been opened, he reached up and took one.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose anybody will care,” thought
Bunny. “Maybe Mr. Jobson was eating some
of these cookies, and he’d have given me
one, anyhow.” Which was probably quite
true.</p>

<p>So the little locked-in boy munched his
ginger cookie and felt better. Still he wanted
to get out, and so when he had gotten rid of
the last crumbs he tried the door again. But
it was still tightly closed.</p>

<p>“I’m going to yell!” said Bunny Brown.
“Somebody will hear me yell and come and
let me out.” So he called: “Open the door!
Open the door and let me out! I’m in here!
Bunny Brown is locked in here!”</p>

<p>But on board a ship, especially on a steamer,
there are many noises made by the machinery.
So the voice of the little boy was not heard
above these sounds. Shut up as he was in a
pantry some distance away from the dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
saloon, Bunny’s voice did not carry very far.
No one heard him calling.</p>

<p>By this time Mr. and Mrs. Brown were getting
very much worried because Bunny could
not be found, and when one after another of
the men about the ship came back from different
places where they had looked to report
that nothing had been seen of the little fellow,
Mrs. Brown was almost ready to cry and Sue’s
lips were quivering.</p>

<p>Just then the dining-room steward, to whom
Bunny had appealed for a cookie, came into
the saloon. He had been in another part of
the ship, having gone there soon after he had
sent Bunny to the pantry steward; so this
man from the dining room, whose name was
Peter Wynn, did not know Bunny was lost
until coming back on duty again.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Mr. Wynn. “Bunny
Brown gone? Why, he was here when I was
setting my tables.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go?” asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“I sent him to Jobson,” was the answer.
“The little lad wanted a cookie. I didn’t have
any, but I knew Jobson was in the storeroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
getting out some packages of cakes and biscuits.
So I sent Bunny there.”</p>

<p>No one had thought of the pantry, but as
soon as Mr. Wynn spoke of it a hurried trip
was made to the place. As Mr. and Mrs.
Brown and some of the ship’s officers came to
the corridor outside the pantry, they heard
Bunny shouting:</p>

<p>“Let me out! Please let me out! I don’t
want to stay here!”</p>

<p>“We’re coming, Bunny! We’re here!
We’re going to let you out!” cried Sue, for
she had followed to see what had happened to
her brother.</p>

<p>It took only a second for one of the men
who knew how to open the pantry, and then
Bunny, with tears on his cheeks, stepped outside.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny!” cried his mother, putting her
arms around him, “why did you go into the
pantry and lock yourself in?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t lock myself in,” said the little
boy. “The door slammed shut and I couldn’t
get it open again.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true,” said Mr. Wynn, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
looked at it. “This door has a habit of sliding
shut and locking itself. We stewards
know about it and always fasten it back. I
don’t see why Jobson didn’t do it. He might
have been locked in himself.”</p>

<p>Just then Steward Jobson, who had gone to
another part of the ship, came back to his
pantry, and he was surprised to learn what
had happened.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” he said. “I finished my work
in there and went out. I did fasten back the
door, and when I went out I took off the fastening,
thinking the door would shut of itself.
And it did, it seems, though I’m sorry to
know it shut Bunny up behind it. He must
have gone in just after I went out. I happened
to remember a moment ago that I had
left the electric light turned on in the pantry,
and I was coming now to turn it off. I’m very
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t get hurt,” said Bunny, smiling
now that the danger and fright were over.
“And I ate some of your cookies.”</p>

<p>“You are quite welcome to all you want,”
said Mr. Jobson, with a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Thus the lost boy was found and every one
was happy. One of the ship’s officers gave orders
to have the pantry door repaired so no
one else would be likely to get shut in.</p>

<p>“Have you eaten yet?” asked Bunny, as he
went back to the dining saloon with his father,
mother and sister.</p>

<p>“No, we were just going to when we missed
you,” said Mrs. Brown. “But I don’t suppose
you want anything to eat now, do you,
Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Sure, I do!” he cried. “Why not,
Mother?”</p>

<p>“I thought you had eaten so many cookies
while you were in the pantry that you
wouldn’t want anything else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t eat many,” said Bunny.
“Only five or six. And I’m hungry yet.”</p>

<p>Afterward Bunny and Sue played some
games out on deck and when evening came
they listened to a story their father told them
and went to bed.</p>

<p>“What a lovely, calm and quiet evening,”
said Mrs. Brown to her husband as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
walked the deck a little while before going
to their staterooms.</p>

<p>“Yes, the ocean is hardly rolling any now,”
said Mr. Brown. “There is no wind at all.
If this were a sailing ship we would be becalmed,
not able to move.”</p>

<p>But the <em>Beacon</em>, being a steamer, plowed
her way through the warm, southern waters
while Bunny and Sue slept soundly. It was in
the morning when Bunny and Sue were dressing,
their parents having gotten up earlier to
go out on deck, that something happened.</p>

<p>Sue had finished putting on her clothes, as
had Bunny, and the children were just leaving
their staterooms when the ship suddenly
trembled and shook and a most terrific blast
sounded in their ears.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” cried Sue, as she made a wild
jump. “What’s that terrible noise, Bunny?
Did you hear it? There it goes again!”</p>

<p>“Sure, I heard it!” answered Bunny, but
Sue could hardly hear him above the strange
blast of sound.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<span class="fs80">FAST AGROUND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Sue Brown was very much startled by the
strange and fearful sound, and so was her
brother Bunny. To the children it was truly
a terrible noise. It was, Sue said, “like a big
bull bellowing in a field.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s a bull, Bunny?” she
asked her brother, as she ran along the corridor
outside the stateroom.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t a bull,” he said, as the strange
noise sounded again, seeming to shake the
whole vessel. “How would they get a bull on
a ship?”</p>

<p>“Well, they have cows on ships,” Sue said.
“One of the sailors told me he milked a cow
once. And if they have cows they can have
bulls, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t seen any bull on this ship,”
stated Bunny, “and we’ve been all over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe they have him hidden down in the
cellar where I was,” suggested Sue. “Oh,
Bunny, I don’t like a bull on a ship! One of
Elizabeth’s dresses is red, and maybe the bull
will chase her!”</p>

<p>Sue was becoming more and more frightened
and Bunny was very uneasy over the
strange sound. Again and again it echoed.
The children were hurrying up on deck to
ask their father or mother what the noise was
when Mr. Brown came down to the staterooms.
He had thought the two little ones
might be frightened and hurried to be with
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, where’s the bull?” cried Sue,
running to him.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any bull,” he answered, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“But what makes that terrible noise?”</p>

<p>“It’s the foghorn, or whistle,” replied Mr.
Brown. “There is a thick blanket of fog all
around the <em>Beacon</em>. The captain and the man
on the lookout cannot see other ships coming
near us, and the men on the other ships cannot
see us. So, in order that we may not run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
into them, the foghorn is being blown. The
other ships can hear it and steer to one side.
Collisions at sea are very dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if it’s only a foghorn!” exclaimed
Bunny. “I’m not afraid of that!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not afraid of a foghorn,” stated
Sue. “But I thought it was a bull bellowing.
I thought at first that we were on shore. Then
when I felt the ship move I knew we were on
water, and I thought the bull was down in the
coal cellar, where I got lost. But I’m glad it
isn’t a bull.”</p>

<p>“The foghorn has a very deep, low note to
make the noise carry a long distance,” explained
Mr. Brown. “It does sound a little
like the bellowing of a bull. I don’t wonder
you were frightened, Sue.”</p>

<p>“Bunny was scared, too,” declared the little
girl.</p>

<p>“Not as much as you were,” stated Bunny,
a bit crossly.</p>

<p>“If you are all dressed I’ll take you on deck
and let you see the fog,” said Mr. Brown.
“It’s like being in a white cloud.”</p>

<p>“Just like going up in an airship!” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
Bunny, though as he had never gone up in
one it is a question how he knew about it.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is like that,” agreed Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>When Bunny and Sue reached the deck and
found the white, wet, clinging mist all about
them they were surprised. The fog was so
dense and thick that they could not see the
bow or stern of the ship when they stood in
the middle, or “amidships,” as a sailor would
call it.</p>

<p>As for looking over the side and seeing any
other vessels that might be approaching or
any land that the <em>Beacon</em> might be nearing,
this was out of the question. A white curtain
of mist seemed drawn all about the steamer,
and Bunny and Sue soon realized that they
were going very slowly. The <em>Beacon</em> was under
half speed.</p>

<p>“Why do we go so slow?” asked Bunny,
just as the foghorn again boomed out its deep
note.</p>

<p>“That’s in case we should happen to bump
into another ship,” explained his father. “By
going slowly less damage would be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Are other ships going slow, too?” Sue
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I don’t hear any of them whistling,” remarked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Probably they are too far off,” his father
told him. “But you may hear some tooting
before the day is over.”</p>

<p>After remaining on deck for a while to look
about them in the fog, Bunny and Sue decided
that it was time for them to go down to
get breakfast.</p>

<p>“It’s rather chilly up here,” said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes, though we’re quite a distance down
south, much nearer the equator than we were,
damp and clammy fog makes it seem cooler
than it has been,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>“You can’t see anything up here,” stated
Sue. “I like it better downstairs where I can
play with Elizabeth. She doesn’t like a fog,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Neither do the sailors,” said Mr. Brown.
“They would much rather go through a storm
at sea than a fog, for they never can tell what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
is going to happen when they can’t see where
they are going or what is coming toward them
out of the dim whiteness.”</p>

<p>As Sue had said, there was nothing to see
from the deck of the <em>Beacon</em> except that white
blanket. There was no wind to blow it away,
for only when there is no wind does a fog descend.
Really, a fog is a big cloud settling
down on the earth, and as soon as the wind
begins to blow the fog scatters.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as the <em>Beacon</em> steamed along
through the mist, little swirling particles of
the fog moved about. But this was all. It
was as if the ship was all alone on a great,
white sea.</p>

<p>“Listen!” exclaimed Bunny as they were
about to go below. “I thought I heard another
ship’s foghorn.”</p>

<p>They all remained quiet, and then from
somewhere out on the ocean came a faint note—the
sound of a far-off whistle.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s another ship, I think,” said Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>Stationed in the bow, or very front part, of
the <em>Beacon</em>, was a man on the lookout. He,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
too, heard this faint and distant whistle and
he called out something to the officer on the
bridge who was steering the ship. This officer
gave several blasts, one quickly after the other,
of the <em>Beacon’s</em> powerful fog whistle. This
was to let the other ship know her signal had
been heard.</p>

<p>Then, from somewhere out in that blanket
of fog, came back some answering toots.</p>

<p>“It’s like playing hide-and-seek, isn’t it?”
asked Sue.</p>

<p>“A good bit like that game, only there isn’t
so much fun in it,” her father answered.</p>

<p>Down below in the snug cabin to which the
fog could not penetrate Bunny Brown and his
sister Sue played nearly all the remainder of
the day. It was more enjoyable than being on
deck, for up there nothing was to be seen. Besides,
toward noon the fog became so thick
that it was almost like rain, and Mr. Brown,
who had gone on deck for a moment, came
down with drops of water on his face and
clinging to his eyebrows and eyelashes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, how funny you look!” laughed
Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Because of the fog, the <em>Beacon</em> was making
only half speed. But as there was no special
hurry in reaching the West Indies this did not
matter much. What worried the officers,
crew and passengers was the danger that in
the fog a collision might happen. So the foghorn
was kept blowing, one blast every half
minute, all day long.</p>

<p>“If they keep it up all night I don’t believe
we’ll sleep,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Maybe the fog will go away at night,”
suggested Bunny.</p>

<p>But the white blanket of mist still enveloped
the vessel when the time for the evening
meal came. Lights were set aglow, but,
as you know if you have ever been out in a
fog, lights do not show very far. So it was
necessary to keep the whistle blowing.</p>

<p>It was about the time Bunny and Sue were
thinking of getting ready for bed that a sudden
quiver ran through the ship. She trembled
and then came to a stop, while the fog
whistle blew louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Somebody bumped into us!” exclaimed
Sue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a collision!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown looked at her husband.</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid so,” he answered. “We certainly
struck something, and we have stopped.
But we didn’t strike very hard.”</p>

<p>There were confused shoutings and calls
throughout the ship, and then some one exclaimed:</p>

<p>“We’re fast aground! We’ve run on a sand-bar
or on some island!”</p>

<span class="fs80">GOING ASHORE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Brown, hearing some one say that the
ship was aground, was not as worried as she
was when she thought that the <em>Beacon</em> was in
a collision.</p>

<p>“If we’re aground, we can go ashore and be
safe and not have to drift around in small
boats,” said Mrs. Brown to her husband.</p>

<p>“We can if the island or the sand-bar that
we have struck on is high enough out of
water,” said the children’s father. “But sometimes
these islands or bars are below the surface,
in which case we naturally couldn’t land
on it. But I don’t believe we shall have to go
ashore. The ship struck so easily that I think
we may soon be able to pull off again. I’ll go
to the captain and see if I can find out what
the matter is.”</p>

<p>“May I go with you?” Bunny Brown
wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I should say not!” said his mother.
“It’s time you and Sue were in your bunks.”</p>

<p>“But if we’re going ashore, Mother,” said
Bunny, “I’ll have to get dressed again.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take Elizabeth,” added the
little girl.</p>

<p>“We aren’t going ashore—not right away,
anyhow,” declared their mother. “Now get
into your bunks and go to sleep.”</p>

<p>This was easy enough to say, but not so easy
to do. Bunny did not want to go alone to the
stateroom he shared with his father. He
wanted his mother to go with him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to stay alone!” declared
Sue. “Mother has to stay with me until
daddy comes back to stay with you,
Bunny!”</p>

<p>It being out of the question for Mrs. Brown
to be in both staterooms at the same time, she
ended the matter by saying:</p>

<p>“You may crawl into my bunk and stay here
with Sue and me until daddy returns, Bunny.
If you fall asleep daddy will carry you into
his room.”</p>

<p>“I won’t fall asleep,” said the little boy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“I’m going to stay awake until daddy comes
back.”</p>

<p>By this time the ship had ceased trembling
and shivering. She had come to a stop and
seemed to be resting calmly and quietly on
some island or sand-bar. She was on an even
keel; that is, she was not tilted to one side or
the other. And had it not been for that startling
bump, any one on board might have
thought the <em>Beacon</em> still floating quietly in the
water.</p>

<p>“Anyhow the foghorn doesn’t blow any
more,” said Sue. “I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed her mother. “It was
getting on my nerves, blowing all the while.”</p>

<p>Though the ship herself was quiet, there
was much confusion on board, it seemed. Outside
in the corridors beyond the staterooms
men could be heard hurrying to and fro.
Voices also were heard, and Bunny and Sue
caught such words as:</p>

<p>“We’re in no danger.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be off in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the tide will lift us off the bar.”</p>

<p>Hearing this talk, either from the ship’s officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
or some of the passengers, made Mrs.
Brown and the children feel that they would
be all right when daylight came.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue had crawled into the berths
of Mrs. Brown’s stateroom, determined to remain
awake until their father should return.
But with the ship so quiet and the fog whistle
no longer blowing, a calmness seemed to settle
over the children. Mrs. Brown sat on a little
stool, saying nothing, and soon she could tell
by the deep, regular breathing of Sue that the
little girl was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown smiled and looked at Bunny
lying in the upper berth. She saw him with
his hands on his eyes.</p>

<p>“Bunny Brown, what are you doing?” she
whispered to him, so as not to awaken Sue.</p>

<p>“I’m holding my eyelids open,” he answered
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Holding your eyelids open!” gasped his
mother. “What for?”</p>

<p>“So I won’t go to sleep,” he answered. “I
want to stay awake until daddy comes back,
but my eyes—my eyes—now—keep going
shut, so I’m holding them open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, you funny boy!” softly laughed his
mother.</p>

<p>But soon, even with Bunny holding his eyelids
up by means of his fingers, the little fellow
fell asleep, as had his sister. Then Mrs.
Brown sat there thinking over the many things
that had happened since they had left their
home in Bellemere.</p>

<p>“And I wonder how poor Mr. Pott, in the
hospital, is getting along,” thought Mrs.
Brown. “I hope he has some word of his lost
son and the missing treasure.”</p>

<p>A little later her husband returned to the
stateroom. Mrs. Brown held up a warning
finger to let him know the children were
asleep, and he made no noise.</p>

<p>“What happened?” she whispered to him.</p>

<p>“We went aground in the fog,” he answered.
“But the ship isn’t damaged and
Captain Ward thinks we shall get off in the
morning. He isn’t going to try it to-night, as
he can’t see what’s around him.”</p>

<p>“Are we on an island?” asked Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Not exactly; but we aren’t far from one.
A sand-bar runs out under water from the island<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
for quite a distance. It was the sand-bar
we grounded on. But we were going so
slowly, on account of the fog, that the ship
isn’t damaged.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” said Mrs. Brown. Then she
told of the children wanting to stay with her
until their father returned, and how Bunny
had tried to hold his eyes open. “I guess you’d
better take him in your room now,” she
added.</p>

<p>“I will,” said Bunny’s father. Gently he
lifted the little sleeping boy in his arms.
Bunny did not awaken, but murmured in his
sleep:</p>

<p>“Don’t let the cow blow the foghorn!”</p>

<p>“He’s still thinking of it,” said his mother
softly.</p>

<p>The next morning when Bunny and Sue
awakened after a quiet night they were surprised
that they had slept through it all and
had not heard their father come back to the
stateroom to tell about the <em>Beacon</em> going
aground.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you wake me up when daddy
came back?” Bunny wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“And me, too!” added Sue.</p>

<p>“You were sleeping so beautifully I didn’t
have the heart,” answered their mother. “Besides,
there wasn’t much to tell you and nothing
to see in the fog and the darkness. But
now the fog has gone, and you may go up on
deck and look about you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going up right now!” cried Bunny,
and he would have gone in his pajamas if his
mother had not caught him and held him
back.</p>

<p>Once they were dressed, however, Bunny
and Sue hurried out on deck. As far as they
could see, there was no bit of land against
which the <em>Beacon</em> had thrust her prow. But
about a mile away was a large island with
palm trees waving in the wind and white surf
breaking on the white sands.</p>

<p>“I thought we had gone aground,” said
Bunny. He was somewhat puzzled, for he
saw water all around the ship.</p>

<p>“The ground is underneath us,” a sailor explained.
“We ran over, and partly on, a sand-bar
about five feet under water. That’s why
you can’t see it. Our keel is fast in the sand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“If we had sand shovels maybe we could
dig ourselves out,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“It would take some pretty big shovels, and
many of them,” laughed the man. “But I
guess when the tide gets higher Captain Ward
will start the engines and they will pull us
off.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue did not understand much
about this. All they knew was that the ship
was still there in the ocean, not moving, and
all about her broke the gentle waves. The
waves were gentle, for it was very calm after
the fog had blown away, just enough wind
moving to carry off the white mist.</p>

<p>“That island looks just like the pictures in
the story about Robinson Crusoe,” said Sue,
remembering that tale of adventure her
mother had read.</p>

<p>“Those are cocoanut trees over there,” declared
Bunny. “I can tell by the way they
look. And I guess cocoanuts are growing on
them. Oh, Sue, wouldn’t you like to go on
that island and get some cocoanuts?”</p>

<p>“I just guess I would!” cried the little girl.
“And so would Elizabeth!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“Pooh! A doll can’t eat cocoanuts!” said
Bunny.</p>

<p>“My doll can,” Sue said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean make believe,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes, make believe,” answered Sue. “Oh,
Bunny,” she went on, “let’s ask daddy and
mother if we can go on the island!”</p>

<p>“That’ll be lots of fun!” said the little boy.</p>

<p>They ran to their parents, who were just
then coming out on deck, and told what they
wanted to do. Mr. Brown said:</p>

<p>“That’s queer! I was just going to ask you
if you wouldn’t like to go ashore.” He turned
to his wife. “We have been on the vessel several
days and you must be getting tired of it.”</p>

<p>“No, not very,” replied Mrs. Brown. “But
it would be nice to go ashore on the island if
we could.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Captain Ward about it,” said Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>He went to find the commander, and, coming
back a little later, Mr. Brown reported:</p>

<p>“Captain Ward says we may go ashore if
we like. He will have a boat lowered for us
and give us two sailors to row us to the shore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
of the island. There is a little sheltered bay
where we can land without going through the
surf. It will be several hours before the tide
is high enough to try to get the <em>Beacon</em> off the
sand-bar, and while we are waiting we can
go on the island.”</p>

<p>“Are any other passengers going ashore?”
Mrs. Brown wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I think we are the only ones,” her husband
said. “The children will like it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ll enjoy it,” said their mother.</p>

<p>When the boat was lowered and Bunny and
Sue were helped into it, they shouted with delight
at the prospect of landing on the island
where the cocoanut trees grew.</p>

<p>“Hold fast!” cried one of the sailors, as he
and his mate rowed the boat away from the
ship and toward the island.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">LEFT BEHIND</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Very calm was the sea over which Bunny
and Sue were being rowed toward the cocoanut
island, as the children called it. The
waves were not at all high and the ocean was
more like Sandport Bay, on which Bunker
Blue often took the Brown children for a row.</p>

<p>“It hardly seems like the ocean at all,” said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“True,” agreed her husband. “We could
almost land on the island through the open
surf.”</p>

<p>“Better not try it, though,” said one of the
sailors, whose name was Will Gand. “We’ll
put in the little bay.”</p>

<p>“It will be safer,” agreed the other man
from the <em>Beacon</em>. His name was Sam Trend.
“We might get in safe, because there isn’t
much surf to speak of,” he went on. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
sometimes a big roller will come up out of the
calmest sea, and it might upset the boat and
get the children’s feet wet.”</p>

<p>“I could take off my shoes and stockings
and wade,” declared Sue.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Sam is right,” said Mrs. Brown.
“We don’t want to get wet when there is no
need.”</p>

<p>“We’re often wet,” announced Sue.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be afraid if the boat upset!”
boasted Bunny. “I can swim!”</p>

<p>“So can I!” added Sue, and it was true.
Young as they were, the two little Browns
had been taught by their father to take care
of themselves in the water.</p>

<p>“Well, if the boat upset the things to eat in
it might get wet,” said the sailor, Will Gand.
“That would be a pity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have we got things to eat in this boat?”
cried Bunny. “I didn’t know that! We can
have a picnic on the island, can’t we?”</p>

<p>“I had one of the stewards pack up some
food in a basket,” said Mr. Brown, pointing
to a large hamper under a seat. “I thought
maybe we would eat our lunch here. It will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
be afternoon before the tide will rise high
enough to float the ship.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean that your picnic lunch
would get wet,” said the sailor who had
spoken of the danger of the boat upsetting.
“I meant that the provisions this boat is
stocked with might get soaked.”</p>

<p>“Is there other food in this boat than that
which Mr. Brown has in the basket?” asked
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes’m,” said Will Gand. “You see
Captain Ward always keeps his lifeboats
stocked with things to eat. He says you never
can tell when you’ll have to launch them in a
hurry, and there might be no time in case of
a wreck when you have to leave the ship in a
rush to put things in the boats. So they’re
kept stocked.”</p>

<p>“And there’s fresh water on board this boat,
too.” The sailor pointed to a locker, or compartment,
up in the bow and nodded toward
another locker in the stern. “They are both
well filled with things to eat,” he said. “It’s
mostly canned stuff, though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that would keep us alive if we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
had to stay here,” said Mr. Brown, with a
laugh. “That’s a good idea of Captain
Ward’s—to have the lifeboats stocked with
food and water.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Sam Trend. “You never can
tell when you’re going to be wrecked, and
sometimes you have to take to the boats a thousand
miles from land. In that case the shipwrecked
ones could live for a week or more
on what’s aboard.”</p>

<p>“But we aren’t shipwrecked, are we?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“No, little man, you aren’t,” answered Will
Gand. “But if we had been going fast and
had hit the sand-bar harder, we might be going
to pieces now instead of having our ship
safe and sound.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to think of it,” said Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>By this time the boat was nearer the island
and it could be seen that Bunny’s guess was
right—the trees that fringed the shore were
cocoanut palms.</p>

<p>“And if there are cocoanuts on them can we
eat some?” Sue asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll see about it,” was her mother’s answer.</p>

<p>“Cocoanuts are all right if you don’t eat too
many,” said Sam Trend. “The milky pulp
of a cocoanut makes a fine drink.”</p>

<p>“I want some!” announced Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“Be patient until you get on shore,” said
his father.</p>

<p>The boat was rowed around to the little bay
where two long, sheltering rocky points kept
the big waves from breaking. It was a calm
and safe place to land.</p>

<p>The boat grated on the sandy, pebbly shore,
and as one of the sailors jumped out to pull it
farther up the beach, Bunny scrambled over
the edge.</p>

<p>“I’m on shore! I’m on shore!” he cried,
gayly dancing about.</p>

<p>“It certainly is a good feeling to know we
are once more on solid land,” sighed Mrs.
Brown, with an air of contentment. “I like
voyaging,” she added quickly, “but I’m glad
to be ashore once again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so am I,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Sue was lifted out of the boat, and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
sailors took out the basket of lunch and carried
it up, putting it under some of the green,
graceful palm trees. Mr. Brown told the
sailors they could roam about wherever they
liked, but to come back to the boat at noon,
when they would be given something to eat.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Will, touching his
cap, and Sam did likewise. Then Mr. Brown
stretched out on his back under one of the
palm trees.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s fine here!” he said with a long
breath of contentment.</p>

<p>“Lovely,” agreed his wife.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a cocoanut!” cried Bunny.</p>

<p>“Don’t eat any without showing them to us
first!” warned his mother, as Sue and the little
boy raced off toward another clump of
trees which were laden with nuts. “He might
eat the wrong thing,” she added.</p>

<p>“You can’t make much of a mistake with a
cocoanut,” said Mr. Brown, laughing. “Still,
it’s best to be on the safe side. Anyhow, they
can’t open a cocoanut without help. I guess
we’ll have to depend on the big knives of the
sailors for that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>A little later Bunny and Sue came running
back, each with a large cocoanut, having
picked them up off the ground where they
had doubtless been blown by the late storm.</p>

<p>“Open it and let us drink some of the juice!”
begged Bunny.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown called to the sailors, and with
their heavy clasp knives they cut through the
soft, but thick, fibrous husk which encloses all
cocoanuts. The nut itself was much smaller
than it appeared on first view, and the shell
enclosing the white meat was much thinner
than the husk covering.</p>

<p>On the end of each inner nut were
three small dark dots, and, being softer than
the rest of the shell, these places were easily
pierced by a sort of drill blade, or punch, in
Will’s knife.</p>

<p>“Now, if you have a cup I’ll pour the milk
out for you,” he said to Bunny, for he had first
opened the nut of the little boy.</p>

<p>There were cups in the lunch basket, and
into one of these was soon gurgling the white,
sweet milky fluid—the milk of the cocoanut,
than which there is no better drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Bunny and Sue much enjoyed theirs. Other
nuts were gathered and opened, Mr. and Mrs.
Brown, as well as the sailors, drinking the
milk.</p>

<p>Then Bunny and Sue played on the sand,
finding pretty shells and pebbles and now and
then a bit of coral. The two sailors strolled
down the sands while Mr. and Mrs. Brown
rested under the shade of the cocoanut palm
trees.</p>

<p>They could look off to the <em>Beacon</em> which
was still aground on the sand-bar, no effort
having as yet been made to pull her off into
deep water.</p>

<p>Almost before the children realized it noon
had come, and Mrs. Brown set out a lunch
from the well-filled basket. Some was given
the sailors, who took their portions down near
the rowboat, pulled up on the beach.</p>

<p>“That steward gave us enough for several
meals,” said Mrs. Brown. “We shall have to
take a great deal of it back with us. There
is no use leaving it here on the island. No
one lives here.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess no one does,” said Mr. Brown.
But he was mistaken about that. “Though if
we stay until late this afternoon, as we may,”
he went on, “Bunny and Sue will probably
want to eat again.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said his wife.</p>

<p>The voyagers wandered about the island,
and in one place they found a small spring of
water trickling down over the rocks in a little
cataract. They drank this water in preference
to some they had brought with them from the
ship.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time we began to think of going
back, I guess,” said Mr. Brown, as the shadows
began to lengthen toward the east.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Brown. “Look, they are
starting to move the <em>Beacon</em> off the sand bar,
I believe!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the stranded steamer, from
the funnel of which black smoke was pouring.</p>

<p>“They’re starting the engines,” said the
sailor, Will Gand.</p>

<p>“And they’ll have her off soon, for it’s high
water now,” added his mate.</p>

<p>“The ship won’t go away and leave us, will
it?” asked Bunny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed his mother.</p>

<p>As they were getting ready to enter the boat
to row back to the steamer one of the sailors
cried:</p>

<p>“There! She’s off the bar! They’ve moved
her!”</p>

<p>The others looked and saw the <em>Beacon</em>
drawing away from the island. She was
headed toward it when she ran on the bar of
sand beneath the waves.</p>

<p>Then, as they still gazed, they saw the ship
slowly swing about and head off and around
the other way, going directly from the island.
Faster and faster she began to move.</p>

<p>“Why! Why!” exclaimed Mrs. Brown.
“They’re going away from us! They’re leaving
us behind!”</p>

<span class="fs80">AN ISLAND HUT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Brown was so excited that she began
running up and down the beach, waving her
handkerchief toward the <em>Beacon</em>, which was
fast sailing away from the cocoanut island.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brown appeared to be very cool
about it.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, my dear,” he said to his wife.
“Captain Ward wouldn’t go away and leave
us on this island.”</p>

<p>“But he is going away!” cried Sue Brown.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see the ship leaving us?” asked
Bunny, and he pointed to it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is going away, but only off the sand-bar,”
said Mr. Brown. “The captain wants
to get into deep water before the tide begins
to fall.”</p>

<p>“That’s all it is,” said Will Gand. “You
can depend on that. Captain Ward wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
leave us cast away on a desert island—though
this isn’t exactly a desert island,” the man said,
with a laugh. “We have things to eat, and
there’s plenty of cocoanuts.”</p>

<p>“And it’s so warm that we could sleep out
of doors all night,” added Sam Trend. “That
is, all except the children, maybe,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“Oh, are we going to stay here all night?”
cried Bunny. “I’d like to do that!”</p>

<p>“If we are, I’m going to make a bed for
Elizabeth,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“I think there will be no need of that,” said
Mrs. Brown. “I did fear at first that the ship
was going away from us. But if you think
she will stop and come back for us, it will be
all right,” she said to her husband.</p>

<p>“Oh, the ship will stop as soon as she gets
into deep water,” said Mr. Brown. “As for
coming back, I hardly think it would be safe
for her to do that. She will probably come to
anchor well beyond the bar and wait for us
to row out to her.”</p>

<p>“Then we had better begin rowing out at
once,” Mrs. Brown said. “It’s getting late,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
and we don’t want to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can start rowing,” agreed the children’s
father.</p>

<p>“Right you are, sir!” exclaimed Will Gand.
“Come on, mate!” he called to his companion.
“Shove off!”</p>

<p>The sailors ran the boat down to the edge of
the water and helped Mrs. Brown, Bunny and
Sue into the craft. Then Mr. Brown got in,
with what remained of the lunch in the basket,
and the sailors pushed the boat into the little
bay until she floated.</p>

<p>Then they began rowing out toward the
<em>Beacon</em>. But of course a ship, going by steam
power, moves faster than a rowboat, and after
a little while Mrs. Brown, who had been looking
across the water that separated them from
the steamer, called out:</p>

<p>“We aren’t gaining on them!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Brown, with a puzzled look
on his face, “we aren’t. I should think they
would be in deep water now, shouldn’t you?”
he asked the sailors.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Sam. “It’s deep
enough water where she is now. Out there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
there’s no danger of going aground again on
the bar.”</p>

<p>“Then why doesn’t Captain Ward stop so
we can get on board?” demanded Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been wondering,” said
the sailor, Will, as he rested on his oars, for
both men had been pulling hard. “It looks
like to me, sir,” he said to Mr. Brown, “that
they’re going on faster. They aren’t going to
drop anchor, nor yet turn around and come
back for us.”</p>

<p>“It does seem so,” said Mr. Brown, and
again he had that worried, curious look on his
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, they must stop! They must stop and
come back for us!” exclaimed Mrs. Brown.
“We can’t stay here alone! Can they have
forgotten us?”</p>

<p>“They can’t have forgotten us!” said Mr.
Brown. “Captain Ward and his mate knew
we were coming ashore!”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t deliberately go away and
leave us, would they, Walter?” asked his wife.
Bunny and Sue wondered what all this would
lead to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, Captain Ward would never do a
thing like that!” said Will Gand. “He isn’t
that kind of a sailor. But he certainly is leaving
us behind.”</p>

<p>“Something’s wrong on board, you can depend
on that,” stated Sam Trend, and he, too,
ceased rowing.</p>

<p>“Something wrong, what do you mean?”
asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“I mean with the ship,” answered Sam.
“Maybe they can’t turn around and come back
after us. The steering gear might have
broken when she went aground.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that could have happened,” said Mr.
Brown. “But that wouldn’t prevent them
from stopping, would it? They could shut
off the engines, anchor, and wait for us,
couldn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Surely they could!” cried Mrs. Brown.
“Something dreadful must have happened.”</p>

<p>“It does look queer,” admitted Will Gand.
“I don’t see why they don’t stop. Something
sure is wrong on board.”</p>

<p>“Unless,” said the other sailor, “the water
is shallower than we know anything about and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
Captain Ward isn’t taking any chances. He
may want to get a mile or two away from the
sand bar.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Mr. Brown. But while they
waited and anxiously watched, the <em>Beacon</em>
steamed farther and farther off until it was
plain that she was not going to stop.</p>

<p>“They have gone away and deserted us!”
exclaimed Mrs. Brown. “What are we going
to do?”</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” repeated her
husband quickly. “Why, we are going back
and camp on Cocoanut Island and have a
regular picnic until the ship comes back for
us! That’s what we’re going to do!” he said.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” cried Bunny Brown. “We’ll
camp on Cocoanut Island and have lots of
fun!”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” echoed Sister Sue.</p>

<p>In a low voice Mr. Brown said to his wife:</p>

<p>“Don’t let the children see that you are worried.
I don’t know why the ship has gone and
left us, but I know she will come back. We
mustn’t frighten the children.”</p>

<p>“No; you’re right,” answered his wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
“I’m sorry I let myself show worry. I’m sure
it will be all right. As you say, we mustn’t
let the children know.”</p>

<p>So, pretending that it was all a jolly lark,
Mr. and Mrs. Brown smiled at Bunny and
Sue. The sailors also realized that they must
pretend it was all in fun, and they were quite
ready to play their parts.</p>

<p>“Well, shall we row back to the island?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mr. Brown. “There is no
use in rowing after the ship any longer. She
may not be back until late to-night.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stay here until then?” asked
Bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>“We have enough to eat,” went on the little
boy. “There’s some in our basket yet and
there’s more in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s plenty in the boat for all of us
for a week,” said Sam Trend.</p>

<p>“Where are we going to sleep?” Sue asked.</p>

<p>“Under the boat,” answered Will.</p>

<p>“Under the boat?” repeated the little girl
curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” went on the sailor. “We’ll haul the
boat up on the sand and turn her over. You
can crawl under it and sleep.”</p>

<p>“I’ve done that many a time,” said Sam.
“It’s as good as a tent when the weather is as
warm as it is down here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t that be nice!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“It will be just like camping out,” added
Bunny.</p>

<p>Owing to the change in the tide, they did
not land on the same stretch of the beach on
which they had first come ashore, but about a
mile to the south. And as the boat was pulled
up on the sand and the castaways got out,
Bunny looked toward the pine trees and some
low bushes growing under them and, pointing,
said:</p>

<p>“Look! There’s a little house!”</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, they beheld a small
hut made of pieces of driftwood and palm
leaves and branches. It stood in a clump of
trees, and the opening was closed with a grass
mat, or curtain, which flapped in the wind.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a nice little house!” cried Sue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
running toward it. “We can stay in there instead
of under the boat to-night!”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” exclaimed Mr. Brown,
catching hold of Sue before she could run
very far.</p>

<p>“But I want to go into the little house,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Some one may already be living there,”
said her mother in a low voice. “We must
wait and see first, Sue.”</p>

<p>Silently they all stood looking toward the
island hut.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">ANOTHER STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny and Sue thought of the hut only as
a place wherein they might play until the ship
came back for them. They thought this would
be in an hour or two.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brown and his wife and the two
sailors began to think that something serious
had happened aboard the <em>Beacon</em> and that she
might not return for many days. In that case
the hut would be a good shelter for the castaways.</p>

<p>“There doesn’t seem to be any one in it,” observed
Mr. Brown, after waiting several seconds.
No one came out of the hut and there
was no sound within.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look as if anybody had ever
lived on this island,” said the sailor, Will.</p>

<p>“Then how did the hut get built?” asked
his mate. “It didn’t put itself up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“That’s evident,” agreed Mrs. Brown.
“Some one must have been here.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, lady,” replied Will.
“But there’s no one here at present.”</p>

<p>They were walking slowly toward the palm
leaf house when Bunny said:</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re asleep.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Whoever lives in there,” Bunny answered,
going a step nearer.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Mr. Brown. “I didn’t
think of that.” Then he suddenly called:
“Hello there! Anybody inside?”</p>

<p>“My, what a shout!” exclaimed his wife,
putting her hands over her ears. “That would
awaken any one.”</p>

<p>But no one came out of the hut, which
seemed to prove that no one was in there.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and take a look,” offered Sam.
Going forward quietly, he thrust his head in
behind the swaying curtain of palm leaves
and grass, woven together as if done by a native.
“Nobody here,” he said. “It will be a
good place to stay for the night, especially for
the children.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t there room for all of us?” asked Mrs.
Brown, who liked the sailors, having found
them kind and obliging.</p>

<p>“We’ll bunk under the boat,” said Will
Gand. “We’re more used to that.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed his mate.</p>

<p>Making sure that the hut was vacant, they
all went closer and looked inside. It contained
nothing except some rudely made mats of
grass and leaves and some low stools made of
wood. In one corner on a flat stone were some
ashes of a fire.</p>

<p>“Some one must have lived here and cooked
here,” said Mrs. Brown. “But as the hut
hasn’t any chimney, I should think they would
have been smoked out.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they used charcoal,” said her husband.
“That doesn’t smoke much and the
fumes of it would go out of the cracks,” and
he pointed to several openings in the walls and
roof of the hut.</p>

<p>“I like it here,” said Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed Sister Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, it will be the best place for us to
stay, I think,” said Mrs. Brown. “Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
really think the ship will be gone all night?”
she asked her husband.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to say,” he answered. “What
happened I don’t know. But I don’t believe
Captain Ward purposely went away and left
us. He will be back as soon as he can and
take us off. Meanwhile we must make the
best of it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do,” said Mrs. Brown,
with a little laugh. “We’ll camp out here. I
brought along some steamer rugs,” she added
to her husband. “They are in the boat. I
thought maybe the children might want to lie
down here on the island. Now the rugs will
be bed clothes for us. We have plenty of
food, but I should like something hot. I don’t
suppose,” she said to the sailors, “that there is
anything like a teakettle in the boat or some
tea? We might make a fire and have tea, if
there was,” she said.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, there’s tea in the boat, and coffee
too,” said Will.</p>

<p>“There is?” cried Mrs. Brown, in delight.</p>

<p>“And a teakettle and a tea pot and a coffee
pot,” added Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“And some pans and an alcohol stove that
burns funny white cubes of fuel,” proceeded
Will.</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” cried Bunny’s mother.
“Why, we can really camp out now on our
wonderful island and live here in the grass
hut. It isn’t going to be half as bad as I
thought. I didn’t see how we were going to
have anything hot, but with tea and coffee and
warm soup—for I suppose there is canned
soup in the boat—we shall be very well off.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m, there’s canned soup in the boat
lockers,” said Will. “Captain Ward always
has his lifeboats stocked with enough to keep
shipwrecked folks comfortable. It was him
as put in the alcohol stove, for he knew that
out in an open boat you can’t build a fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as we must stay here,” said
Mr. Brown, “we had better get the things
out of the boat and see about a meal. It will
soon be time for supper. We’ll also get up the
steamer rugs and see about making some beds
for the children,” he added.</p>

<p>“Sam and I will cut some palm leaves and
grass and put them in the hut,” offered Will.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
“They’ll make a soft bed with a rug on top.”</p>

<p>“You’d better put some grass under your
boat, if you are going to sleep beneath it,”
said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do,” agreed Sam.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown looked off across the ocean.
Only a faint smoke from the <em>Beacon</em> was now
to be seen. She was going farther and farther
away every minute. Mr. Brown could not
understand it.</p>

<p>Soon the island was a busy place, with the
sailors bringing the things up out of the boat
and with Mrs. Brown getting ready to cook a
meal over the alcohol stove. It was really
rather a large stove and two or three things
could be heated at once in special pans made
to fit closely together.</p>

<p>There were many kinds of canned food in
the boat lockers, and the balmy evening air
that hovered over Cocoanut Island, as Bunny
called it, was soon fragrant with the aroma of
the cooking. Sue and her brother sniffed the
air hungrily. So did the two sailors.</p>

<p>There were tin plates and cups in the boat
and a box cast up on the beach was made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
serve as a table. Soon all were seated about
it on the warm sand, eating a jolly meal.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we came here,” said Bunny
Brown.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” echoed his sister Sue. “Elizabeth
likes it, too. Eat your dinner, Elizabeth,” she
went on, pretending to feed the doll.</p>

<p>“Pooh, she can’t eat!” scoffed Bunny.</p>

<p>“She can so!” cried Sue. “My child can
sleep and eat and talk.”</p>

<p>“You can’t hear her talk,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you can’t hear her,” admitted
Sue. “She talks, all the same. She talks
in whispers.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never heard her,” said the little
boy.</p>

<p>After the meal the children played on the
sand and went down to the edge of the water,
finding a big crab which they watched as it
walked along in its funny, side motion.</p>

<p>“Better not try to pick it up,” warned Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>But Bunny and Sue, being children of a fish
dealer, knew enough to let big crabs alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>It grew dark quickly, as it always does
down near the equator, and when Mrs. Brown
had made up the rug beds for the two children
they were glad to crawl into them.</p>

<p>“It’s funny, going to bed with your clothes
on,” laughed Bunny, for neither he nor his sister
could undress, there being no pajamas for
them.</p>

<p>“It’s like camping out,” his father said, and
indeed it was. Will and Sam made their bed
beneath the overturned boat, far up on the
sand out of reach of the tide, and Mr. and
Mrs. Brown lay down in the hut with the children.</p>

<p>For a time neither the father nor the mother
of Bunny and Sue could sleep. But at last
they dropped off into slumber. How long
they were asleep they did not know. But they
were suddenly awakened by Bunny calling
out:</p>

<p>“I’m all wet! The rain is coming in on
me!”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown had with him a pocket flashlight,
and, switching this on, he saw a stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
of water coming through the roof of the hut.
And, at the same time, he became aware that
there was a storm.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing and shaking the
frail grass hut. Out on the beach the waves
could be heard pounding the sand.</p>

<p>“What is happening?” asked Mrs. Brown,
who was now awake, as was also Sue.</p>

<p>“Bunny is getting a shower bath,” said Mr.
Brown. “It’s raining and the hut is leaking.”</p>

<p>“What a terrible storm!” cried Mrs.
Brown, as the hut shook in the gale of wind.
Then Sue began to cry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br>
<span class="fs80">CAMPING OUT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny Brown and his sister Sue began to
think that never in all their lives had they felt
so sad and unhappy. They were on a strange
island, and though at first it had seemed fun,
now, without any soft bed to sleep in, sheltered
under only a grass and palm leaf hut, and with
the rain coming in—well, it is no wonder Sue
cried. Bunny started to shed a few tears, and
then he remembered that his daddy, only a
few days before, had said that “boys of your
age, Bunny, don’t cry.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown, too, began to think
that this was the most miserable of all the
many adventurous trips they had taken with
the children. They were wondering about
the ship’s coming back, though Bunny Brown
and his sister Sue did not think so much of
this matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Brown quickly saw that he must
do something to cheer up his family. There
was no real danger, he decided.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Sue!” he called to his little girl,
who was already in her mother’s arms. “A
little rain isn’t going to hurt, is it, Son?” he
asked the small lad.</p>

<p>“No—I—now—I like it,” replied Bunny,
thus turning himself into a little hero.</p>

<p>“See, Sue,” laughed Mr. Brown, as he
pulled the rug and grass bed of the children
out from under the hole in the roof, “Bunny
likes it. Don’t cry.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t crying ’cause—’cause—Bunny was
getting wet,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“Then why are you crying, dear?” asked
her mother.</p>

<p>“’Cause—maybe—I guess—’cause I’m
afraid Elizabeth will catch cold,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown laughed at this, and
even Bunny smiled. Really Sue made up that
excuse right out of her own head, so to speak.
She was crying because she was a little afraid
and things were strange, but she did not want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
to say so, and that is why she spoke of Elizabeth’s
catching cold.</p>

<p>“Well, we will cover your doll up so she
won’t get wet,” said Mrs. Brown. “But, dear
me!” she added to her husband, “I’m afraid
we’re all going to get wet. Look, the roof is
leaking in another place, Walter.”</p>

<p>Surely enough, drops were coming through
just over the pile of grass and leaves which
had served for Mrs. Brown’s and her husband’s
bed.</p>

<p>“Looks as if we’d have to move out of our
picnic hut,” said Mr. Brown. “I guess there
will be room for all of us beneath the boat.”</p>

<p>Before they could make a move to get out
the parents of the children, and Bunny and
Sue also, heard voices calling to them outside
the hut.</p>

<p>“Hello in there!” a voice shouted.</p>

<p>Another asked:</p>

<p>“Are you all right in the hut?”</p>

<p>“It’s the two sailors,” said Mr. Brown. His
wife said:</p>

<p>“No, we’re not quite all right. The roof is
leaking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what we came up to fix,” said Will
Gand. “I saw last night that that roof wasn’t
very tight. Sam and I have a big piece of
canvas from the boat. We’ll throw it over the
roof and that will keep out the rain. Can you
show a light? It’s as dark as a coal bin out
here.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>He stepped to the door of the hut and
flashed the powerful little electric torch. In
its glow he could see the two sailors standing
in the rain. Mrs. Brown also had a glimpse
of them and called:</p>

<p>“Oh, you poor men, you’re getting soaking
wet!”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind that!” laughed Sam Trend.
“We’re used to it. And it’s a warm rain—it
will do us good.”</p>

<p>The sailors were carrying a large piece of
canvas between them, and as Mr. Brown held
the light one of them climbed a tree near the
hut and tossed the tarpaulin over the grass
shelter. It was pulled down over the sides
and made fast with ropes, as only sailors know
how to do work like that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“Now you’ll be dry,” said Will.</p>

<p>“Yes; but you two are all wet,” replied Mrs.
Brown from within the shelter of the hut,
through the roof of which no more rain came.</p>

<p>“Oh, we don’t mind,” said Sam.</p>

<p>Fastening the big canvas over the hut was
exactly like putting the grass shelter inside a
tent. And now, no matter how hard it rained,
Bunny and his sister would not get wet. The
men ran back to their shelter under the boat
and the storm raged harder than ever.</p>

<p>The rain seemed to come down in bucketfuls,
as one of the sailors said afterward, and
the wind blew hard, though not hard enough
to rip off the canvas or tear apart the frail hut.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re better off than we were,” said
Mr. Brown, when it was certain that no more
rain was coming in.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Brown. “Now go
to sleep, my dears.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go on the ship to-morrow?” Sue
wanted to know. “I don’t think Elizabeth
likes it here very much.”</p>

<p>“Everything will be nicer to-morrow,” said
Mrs. Brown, not giving any decided answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
about the ship, for in her heart she did not
believe it would come back. But she did not
want to say so. “To-morrow the sun will be
shining,” she went on, “and we’ll pick some
more cocoanuts and have a picnic in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shall we?” cried Bunny, smiling now.</p>

<p>“Surely we will.”</p>

<p>“And maybe you’ll bake a cocoanut cake,
Mother!” exclaimed Sue.</p>

<p>“Well, we have plenty of cocoanuts, that’s
sure,” laughed Mrs. Brown. “But I’m afraid
I couldn’t quite make a cake. However, we’ll
have some fun when the sun shines to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have lots of fun,” echoed Bunny.
“And I’m going in swimming.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” was all his father
would promise. And when the children were
once more asleep, with the rain pattering on
the canvas roof, Mrs. Brown said to her husband:</p>

<p>“I only hope the sun will shine to-morrow
and that the <em>Beacon</em> will come back for us.”</p>

<p>“I think everything will be all right,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Mr. Brown. “Storms don’t generally
last very long down here at this time of year.
And the ship will surely return. She would
have done so at once, I’m sure, only something
must be wrong with the machinery.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they anchor and wait for us to
row out to them?” asked Mrs. Brown.
“That’s what I can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Captain Ward was afraid of anchoring
so near a sand-bar with another storm
coming up,” suggested her husband. “I’m
sure they will be back for us to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I hope so!” sighed Mrs. Brown, as she
again lay down on the pile of grass and tried
to get a little sleep.</p>

<p>She dozed off, as did her husband, for they
were very tired. When they awakened it was
to hear Bunny gayly shouting:</p>

<p>“The sun is shining! The rain has stopped!
I’m going in swimming in the ocean!”</p>

<p>“So am I! I’m going swimming, too!”
cried Sue.</p>

<p>“Stop them! Don’t let them go in yet! It
would be just like them to dash into the water.
Stop them, Walter!” cried Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Brown jumped up from the grass bed
and saw Bunny and Sue going out of the door
of the hut, Sue carrying her Elizabeth doll
whom, doubtless, she intended bathing.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” laughed Mr. Brown,
catching hold of the children. “Let’s see
about this swimming business! I must pick
out a good place for you—you don’t want to
go in where there are any whales.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not!” cried Sue.</p>

<p>“All right—we’ll wait,” agreed Bunny,
who had not thought of this.</p>

<p>As Bunny had said, the storm had stopped
and the sun was shining. It was a lovely
morning and the sea was calm. Cocoanut Island
was a beautiful place.</p>

<p>Will and Sam had come out from beneath
the boat and were down at the edge of the sea
washing their hands and faces.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon have some hot coffee made for
you!” called Will, for the alcohol stove had
been put back in the boat locker with the spare
food.</p>

<p>In a little while Mr. and Mrs. Brown were
sipping the hot coffee while Bunny and Sue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
were drinking warm milk. No, it was not
real, fresh milk, for the milkman did not stop
at Cocoanut Island and there were no cows on
it, so far as the castaways knew. But in the
boat were cans of evaporated milk, and when
this had been warmed with a little hot water
it made a good drink for the children.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll get ready to camp out for the
rest of the day or until the ship comes back,”
said Mr. Brown. “One of the first things to
do, I think, is to make another grass hut for
the sailors. I don’t like to think of them
sleeping under the boat.”</p>

<p>“We don’t mind it,” laughed Will. “But
we can easily make another hut, if you like.
And we’ll fix the roof on yours to-day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was gazing out over the ocean.
Suddenly she pointed and cried:</p>

<p>“Is that the ship coming back?”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WOODEN HOUSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a time it seemed that the small, black
speck on the sea, toward which Mrs. Brown
pointed, might be the <em>Beacon</em> returning. But
soon Will Gand remarked:</p>

<p>“That’s only a bird—a seagull, I guess. It’s
soaring upward.”</p>

<p>And that is what the speck did—mount,
showing that it must have been a bird of some
sort, though, at a distance, it looked like a
ship on the water.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” sighed Mrs. Brown, greatly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” her husband said. “It will
come some time to-day, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if the ship comes back or not,”
declared Bunny Brown. “I like it here
now.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed his sister Sue. “We’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
going to have some fun, aren’t we, Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered. “We’re going in
swimming, aren’t we, Daddy?”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown looked at his wife, smiled, and
answered:</p>

<p>“As we haven’t any bathing suits for you
two, I think that wading is about all you can
do. Won’t that be enough?”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue decided that it would be,
and perhaps they were thinking of the
“whale” about which their father had spoken
in a joking way.</p>

<p>A little later Mrs. Brown let the children
take off their shoes and stockings and splash
about in the little cove where there was no
surf and where the boat had first landed.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was busy helping the sailors
make another hut of the big palm leaves and
grass which grew all about. Sam Trend had
been in the tropics before and had watched
the natives make their huts, so he knew how it
was done and could tell the others.</p>

<p>In a short time a second hut was made near
the first one, and this was for Will and Sam
to sleep in, since it was somewhat cramped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
under the boat, though they did not find any
fault.</p>

<p>“I wonder who made that first hut?” said
Mrs. Brown to her husband, coming up the
beach and leaving Bunny and Sue paddling
in the warm water.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some natives lived here at one
time,” said Mr. Brown. “Though we haven’t
seen any signs of their being here now, it’s
true. Or the hut may have been put up by
some fishermen who stayed here for a time.
It’s a good thing they left it for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” agreed his wife. “But don’t
you think we had better take a walk around
this island to see how big it is and whether or
not there really is any one else besides ourselves
on it?”</p>

<p>“That would be a good idea,” replied Mr.
Brown. “And on the other side of the island
we may find a better place to stay than where
we are.”</p>

<p>It was planned to make the trip as soon as
the grass hut was finished, which would be in
about a half hour. Mrs. Brown walked about
and picked up some of the cocoanuts which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the wind of the night before had blown down.</p>

<p>“Bunny and Sue will want some of the cocoanut
milk to drink after they finish playing
in the water,” she said. She looked down the
beach at the two children splashing about.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sue gave a scream and dashed out
of the water, her little skirts held high.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bunny! Bunny!” she cried. “It’s a
big crab and it’s going to bite my toes!”</p>

<p>Bunny looked in the water where his sister
pointed after she was safe up on the dry beach.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a crab at all,” he shouted. “It’s
just a bunch of seaweed. Come on back!”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow, it felt like a crab nibbling
my toes,” said Sue.</p>

<p>Slowly she went back to her brother who
was still in the water, but before Sue went in
she looked carefully to make sure there were
no crabs. Bunny held up on a stick the bunch
of seaweed which was what really had tangled
itself around Sue’s legs.</p>

<p>“Play in the water a little longer,” called
Mrs. Brown to the children. “Then we are
going to walk around the island.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be fun!” cried Bunny. “Maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
we’ll find something. Come on, Sue! I’ve
waded enough.”</p>

<p>“So have I,” said his sister. “Do you think
we’ll find any flowers, Mother? I want to get
some for Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! A doll doesn’t want any flowers!”
cried Bunny. “She can’t smell them!”</p>

<p>“My Elizabeth doll can smell!” retorted
Sue.</p>

<p>“Huh! Make believe!” scoffed Bunny.</p>

<p>“Well, make believe is all right,” and Sue
seemed well satisfied with this.</p>

<p>They sat on the sands until their feet were
dry enough to put on their shoes and stockings.
By this time Mr. Brown had finished
helping the two sailors build their hut and
was ready to go with his wife and children
for a walk around the island.</p>

<p>“We’ll stay here near the boat,” said Will.
“Can’t tell but what some natives might be
hiding in the bushes and would come out to
take our provisions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” agreed Mr. Brown. “But
I hardly think any one is on this island but
ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Anyhow, if the ship comes back, some one
ought to be here to signal her,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Oh, by all means!” said Mrs. Brown.
“Wave to her, make a smoky fire, do anything
to let her know we are here, and don’t let her
get away without taking us off.”</p>

<p>Leaving the two sailors on watch, Mr. and
Mrs. Brown started to walk along the shore
of the island and away from their little camp.
Bunny and Sue followed. The children were
always glad to go walking with their parents,
for there were so many interesting things to
see.</p>

<p>Cocoanut Island was a larger place than
Mr. Brown had at first thought. They went
to the top of a little hill not far from the
beach, and from this height they could see that
the place where they had been left ashore was
several miles long and about a mile wide.</p>

<p>“It will take us too long to walk around the
island,” decided Mr. Brown, as they came
down the hill on the other side. “I think the
best plan will be to walk across the place and
see what’s there.”</p>

<p>They did this. In about half an hour, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
they did not walk fast, they reached the other
shore. There was a little cove here also, and
palm trees were waving in the wind.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any better, though,” said Mrs.
Brown, “than the place where we have our
camp.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is some better,” said Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“There’s a wooden house here. Look!”</p>

<p>To the surprise of his father and mother,
who had not yet seen it, Bunny pointed out a
little house which stood in a clump of palm
trees some distance up the beach.</p>

<p>“It’s a wooden house,” went on Bunny.
“And it would be nicer to live in than the
grass hut. Let’s go to the wooden house.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Brown were very much surprised.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs80">THE WILD MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bunny and Sue would at once have rushed
down the sand toward the funny little wooden
house, just as they would have dashed toward
the grass hut when they first saw that. But
Mr. Brown called to them to wait.</p>

<p>“We want to see if any one is in that hut
before we go too near,” he said. “Perhaps
some one is living there.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Bunny, and Sue clasped
her doll closer as if she feared some one from
the wooden house would come forth to take
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather queer to find a wooden house
on an island like this?” asked Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” agreed her husband. “This
must have been built by a white man, for natives
would not take the trouble to put up anything
more than a leaf or grass hut, which
does them very well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“However, there doesn’t seem to be any one
in that place—neither native nor white man,”
went on Mrs. Brown after a pause, during
which they all looked intently at the small
house. “It may be like the hut—deserted.”</p>

<p>“It seems so,” said her husband, while
Bunny and Sue waited for what would next
happen. “Hello in there!” suddenly called
Mr. Brown in a loud voice. “Is any one
there?”</p>

<p>No one answered nor did any one come
forth. After waiting a little longer Mr.
Brown walked slowly toward the house, followed
by his wife and the children. And as
he drew near it Mr. Brown cried out:</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a ship’s deckhouse. This is part
of a wrecked ship that has been washed up on
shore. I thought it looked so at the first
glimpse I had of it, and now I am sure. This
house is part of a ship.”</p>

<p>“What ship?” Sue Brown wanted to know.</p>

<p>“That would be hard to say unless the name
of the vessel was painted somewhere on the
house,” answered her father. “But let’s look
inside.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>When they had done this they found the
ship’s house to be well fitted up for a home.
On one side of the place were two berths like
those in the <em>Beacon</em>, only smaller. One of
these was arranged with blankets and a pillow
and it looked as if it was ready for some one
to sleep in. The upper berth was not made
up, but there was a pile of blankets in it.</p>

<p>In the middle of the little house was a table,
and on it were some dishes. A few boxes
served as chairs. In a corner a rough fireplace
had been made of stones, plastered together
with mud and sand.</p>

<p>“Some one has been living here!” exclaimed
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed her husband. “And it looks,
from the neatness of it, to be the home of some
sailor. No native would keep the place so
nice.”</p>

<p>“Look! Here is a lot of canned food,” said
Mrs. Brown, opening the door of a cupboard.
On the shelves were arranged many cans of
things to eat.</p>

<p>“I can guess what has happened,” said Mr.
Brown. “The ship, of which this deckhouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
was a part, was wrecked on this island, or near
it. There must have been big waves to have
washed the house this far up on the sand, or
else the shipwrecked sailors hauled it here.
There must have been more than one of them
to do the work, for the house is heavy.”</p>

<p>“Well, where are the sailors now?” Bunny
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Maybe they went home,” suggested Sue.</p>

<p>“They seem to have deserted the place,”
said Mr. Brown. “Like the grass hut, this
place has been lived in, but there is no one
here now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown, who had been walking about
the place looking at things here and there,
went over to the stone fireplace and held her
hand down near the ashes.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mother, are your hands
cold?” asked Sue.</p>

<p>“No, I wanted to see if these ashes were
warm,” was the answer. “And they are!” she
called to her husband. “Feel, Walter! These
embers aren’t cold yet! That shows some one
has been living here very lately. They must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
have gone out just before we came in! They
must have cooked their breakfast here!”</p>

<p>She stood up and looked at her husband.
He came over and put his hand down near the
ashes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “there has been a fire here
within two hours. I am sure now that there
is some one on this island besides ourselves.
We must look about.”</p>

<p>“This is very strange,” said Mrs. Brown.
“I wonder who it can be?”</p>

<p>“Some sailor, you can depend on that,” her
husband answered. “No one but a sailor
would have things arranged like this. It is in
shipshape fashion. We must send Will and
Sam over to look at this. They may be able
to tell from what ship this house was torn
away.”</p>

<p>“Could we come and live here?” Bunny
asked. “I think it’s nicer than the grass hut.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” added Sue. “It’s got a door to it
that shuts, and windows with glass in ’em.”</p>

<p>This last was only partly true, for out of the
windows, of which there were two on either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
side, most of the glass was broken. It was surprising
that even a single pane remained,
when one stops to think of the violent storm
that had torn the house loose from the ship.</p>

<p>“I hardly think we had better move our
camp over here until we see who is living
here,” said Mr. Brown. “Whoever does, has
a right to this place and they might not like
visitors. But if we find that the person who
left this place isn’t coming back, then we
would have a right to come here. Let’s look
about a bit outside.”</p>

<p>There were several chests and boxes in the
deckhouse, but these Mr. Brown did not open,
though they were not locked. He wanted first
to find out what sort of person or persons had
been living in the place, cooking over the fireplace
and sleeping in the lower bunk.</p>

<p>However, there was little outside to tell
anything. Scattered about the beach were
broken boxes and barrels and what seemed to
be part of a wrecked vessel of some sort.</p>

<p>“It was a sailing ship and not a steamer,
that much is sure,” said Mr. Brown, as he and
the children picked up pieces of wood. “If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
we could find out the name we would know
more about the wreck.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown was growing curious, now that
it was certain some one else was on the island
besides themselves. She wondered who he
was and how long he had been here.</p>

<p>“If we could only find out who it is,” she
said to her husband.</p>

<p>“We will in a little while, I’m sure,” he
said. “The place isn’t very big.”</p>

<p>“But there are many places to conceal one,”
Mrs. Brown went on, a sudden thought coming
to her. “The cocoanut palm trees and
bushes are very thick. Even now some one
may be hiding and looking out on us.”</p>

<p>“Whoever has been living in that house,”
said Mr. Brown, turning to glance at it, “is a
white man, I’m sure. He wouldn’t hide and
spy out on us. He would be only too glad to
see us, for if he is here by himself he must be
very lonesome. What I think is that he has
had his breakfast and has gone off hunting or
fishing to get something more to eat. Probably
he is tired of living on canned food and
wants some fresh meat or fish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“I wish he’d let me help him fish,” put in
Bunny Brown. “I could fish here all right,
couldn’t I, Daddy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If we had a hook and line we might,” was
the answer. “But we didn’t bring any of those
things with us.”</p>

<p>“They might be in the boat,” suggested
Mrs. Brown. “So many things were in her
that I feel quite sure it will contain a fishing
outfit.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” assented her husband. “But
now we had better go back to camp and tell
Will and Sam what we have found.”</p>

<p>“I think that would be best,” said Mrs.
Brown. “They, being sailors, would know
what sort of ship this house came from. And
when we return this man—whoever he may be—will
probably be back. Then we can see
who he is.”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue had wandered off a little
way from their parents during this talk. They
now came running back, somewhat out of
breath and much excited.</p>

<p>“I think—” panted Bunny, “I think he’s
coming back now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Who?” asked his father.</p>

<p>“The man that lives in this house.”</p>

<p>“And he’s a wild man!” gasped Sue.</p>

<p>“A wild man?” echoed her mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s got long black hair and long
black whiskers and he looks funny. There he
goes now! Look!”</p>

<p>Both children pointed to an opening in the
bushes and Mr. and Mrs. Brown saw a strange
figure running away. As Sue had said, he
did, indeed, look like a “wild man,” for his
hair was long and straggly and his beard was
so lengthy that it flowed over his shoulders as
he ran.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Bunny. “He’s a wild man
all right!”</p>

<span class="fs80">SEARCHING FOR THE WILD MAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>With a cry of surprise Mr. Brown would
have run after the strange being—whether he
was really a wild man or not remained to be
seen—but Mrs. Brown caught her husband by
the arm and held him back.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Brown. “I
want to catch that fellow and find out who he
is.”</p>

<p>“Had you better go?” asked his wife.
“Would it be safe?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m not afraid of him!” laughed the
father of Bunny and Sue. “He’s afraid of us.
See how he ran!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there may be others besides him,”
said Mrs. Brown. “They may be hiding in
the bushes and they may have sent him on
ahead to spy on us. Besides, if you go away
from us, this man might circle around and
scare Bunny and Sue.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>“We’re not afraid of being scared by a wild
man,” declared the little boy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better not leave you to chase
this man,” said Mr. Brown, after thinking it
over. “We’ll go back to our grass-hut camp
and I’ll get Will and Sam to come with me.
We’ll chase this fellow and find out who he is.
He looks to me like a white man.”</p>

<p>“I think he is a white man,” agreed Mrs.
Brown. “But perhaps he has been shipwrecked
and living on this island so long by
himself that he is out of his mind and has gone
wild.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” her husband admitted. “Anyhow,
Will and Sam and I will search for him.
Well, we’ve had some surprises to-day, and
now it will be best, I think, to go back to our
own little camp. Though if this wild man
isn’t going to use his comfortable little house
I’d like to have it to live in.”</p>

<p>“It is better than the hut,” Mrs. Brown said.
“But we couldn’t come here until that fellow
is caught,” and she waved her hand toward
the underbrush in which the strange creature
had vanished. “It’s his.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Bunny and Sue looked with wide-open eyes
in the same direction hoping, yet also half
fearing, to catch another glimpse of the man
with the long black hair and beard. But he
did not show himself.</p>

<p>Climbing up over the ridge of low hills
which ran down the middle of Cocoanut Island,
the castaways were soon nearing the little
bay where they had first landed.</p>

<p>“I hope Will and Sam have seen the <em>Beacon</em>
and have signaled for her to take us off,” said
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“I hardly think the ship has returned,” Mr.
Brown said. “If she had we would have
heard her whistle. But she will be here by
night or by to-morrow morning, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, we’re having fun here,” said
Bunny Brown. “I liked it on the rolling
ocean, but I like it just as much on Cocoanut
Island.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Sue. “And please,
Mother, could I have some more cocoanut
juice to drink?”</p>

<p>“Yes, when we get to the hut you may have
come cocoanut milk,” her mother said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>Will and Sam, who had been busy making
their hut comfortable as a place to spend the
night in case the ship did not come back, were
much surprised to hear about the little
wooden house and about the wild man.</p>

<p>“He’s a shipwrecked sailor, like enough,”
declared Will.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if we can catch him after lunch,”
Mr. Brown remarked. “Poor fellow, he may
have been frightened on seeing us.”</p>

<p>Some cocoanuts were opened and the milk
drained off into cups for the children to drink.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brown prepared a simple meal, doing
the best she could with the canned goods from
the boat’s lockers. She looked it over and
noted that they had enough to last them a week
or more.</p>

<p>“But I hope we don’t have to stay here that
long,” she told her husband.</p>

<p>“If our food gives out we can ask the wild
man to let us have a share of his,” Mr. Brown
said, with a laugh. “And he might be glad to
have some one to keep him company.”</p>

<p>After talking the matter over it was decided
to let Will and Sam go together to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
look at the deckhouse on the other side of the
island, while Mr. Brown stayed with his wife
and children near the grass huts. It was
thought the two sailors could perhaps tell from
what vessel the wooden house had been torn.</p>

<p>“And if you see the wild man try to find out
who he is,” suggested Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“We will,” promised the sailors as they
started off after lunch.</p>

<p>Bunny wanted to go with them, and of
course Sue clamored to go where her brother
did. But their father and mother would not
allow this.</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of the wild man!” boasted
Bunny.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be if Sam and Will would stand
in front of me,” said Sue, at which the others
laughed.</p>

<p>Left to themselves in the camp of the grass
huts, Mr. and Mrs. Brown sat talking for a
while on the strange happening that had made
them castaways on Cocoanut Island.</p>

<p>“When I heard poor Mr. Pott telling how
he had been shipwrecked,” said Mrs. Brown,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
“I little thought how soon we would be in the
same plight.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t exactly shipwrecked,” objected
her husband.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as bad,” she replied, smiling.
“We’re marooned on this island with a wild
man.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Will and Sam will tame him,” Mr.
Brown said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Bunny, having caught the name of Mr.
Pott, came over to his father and mother to
ask:</p>

<p>“Did we have any letters from Mr. Pott?
Did he say he liked the apples I took to him?”</p>

<p>“And the flowers?” cried Sue. “I took
flowers!”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t heard from Mr. Pott,”
said Daddy Brown. “The only way we could
have heard while aboard the <em>Beacon</em> would
have been by radio, and I guess poor Mr. Pott
isn’t able to send any wireless messages.”</p>

<p>“Poor old man!” murmured Mrs. Brown.
“I wonder whether he’s heard from his lost
son?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“And about the treasure!” added Bunny.
“He wanted the treasure, too!”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’m afraid he’ll never find
either,” said Mr. Brown. The children were
playing about on the sand, now and then tossing
stones and shells into the water, when they
saw their father looking at a tall, straight
palm tree which grew near the shore. He
went into the hut where they had slept and
came out with a piece of canvas—a small end
of the tarpaulin that had been put over the
leaky hut.</p>

<p>“What you going to do, Daddy?” Bunny
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of putting up a flag on this
tree when Sam and Will come back,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“A flag?” cried Bunny. “What for? Is
this the Fourth of July?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered his father with a laugh.
“Though it is quite warm enough for that.
No, I want a flag to fly in the wind so those on
the <em>Beacon</em> will see it when they come back
and know we are still here. It is to be a signal
flag, not a regular flag.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“I thought it looked like a funny flag,” replied
Bunny. “It hasn’t any stars or stripes or
anything.”</p>

<p>“No, we don’t need that for a signal flag,”
said Mr. Brown, as he looked at the piece of
weather-stained canvas in his hand. “Anything
that will flutter in the wind will do.
You see the <em>Beacon</em> may circle about and come
back to the island from the other side. But
if they come back on this side they will know
where we are. Yes, this tree will make a good
flag pole. I’ll have Will or Sam climb it and
fasten on this piece of canvas when they come
back.”</p>

<p>“Will they bring the wild man back with
them when they come?” Sue asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>Immediately Sue began to run toward the
hut.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” called her mother.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hide Elizabeth where the
wild man can’t find her,” answered the little
girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be silly!” said her mother. “The
wild man is only a poor shipwrecked sailor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
I’m sure, perhaps out of his mind a little on
account of living alone so long. He won’t hurt
you nor your doll, Sue. Don’t be foolish.”</p>

<p>This made Sue feel a little ashamed of herself,
and she and Bunny played about the
beach, again taking off their shoes and stockings
and going in wading.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Will and Sam were searching
for the wild man. They soon found the little
wooden house, discovered by Bunny
Brown, and went inside. No one was there,
and the sailors began looking about to see if
they could tell from what ship it had been
torn by a storm.</p>

<p>While they were looking about them, not
disturbing anything in the house, however,
Will suddenly called:</p>

<p>“Hark! I hear a noise outside!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s the wild man!” said Sam.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="fs80">CAUGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The two sailors each had the same thought.
They wanted to catch this strange man,
whether or not he was really wild. So when
Will and Sam, who were inside the queer little
wooden house, heard that noise outside
they at once thought they had a chance to
catch the wild man, if it should prove to be
that person who had caused the sound.</p>

<p>“Lay low and go easy,” whispered Will to
Sam. “I’ll take a look out and see if it’s him.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” whispered Sam.</p>

<p>Very quietly Will went on his tiptoes to the
door and looked out. Instantly he darted
back inside the little house again.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s coming up the path. He must
have stepped on a stick that broke and made
that noise. But he’s coming right up here—it’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
his home, you know. When he comes inside
we’ll grab him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sam. “But it’s sort of
rough to treat a man like that when he comes
into his own house. You wouldn’t like that,
Will, and I wouldn’t either.”</p>

<p>“No, maybe not,” agreed the other sailor,
“But this is for his own good. We aren’t going
to hurt the wild man. We want to be
friends with him. But very likely he’s so wild
he won’t trust us. All we want to do is to talk
to him and tell him we’ll be friends and help
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess that’s all right,” agreed
Sam.</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on Will, “we don’t want
this fellow with his long hair and beard scaring
Bunny and Sue.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s so,” admitted Sam. “He is sort
of scary looking,” he added, as he peered from
the window and saw the wild man, as they
called him, coming up the path that led to the
little wooden house amid the cocoanut trees.
“He looks like some monkeys I’ve seen in the
jungle,” added Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a queer chap,” said Will. “Now
don’t make any noise and we’ll catch him.”</p>

<p>The sailors had talked in whispers since the
noise had told them the stranger was approaching.
They now placed themselves, one
on either side of the door, to be ready to grab
the fellow when he should come in. From
where they stood, Will and Sam could watch
the wild man coming along.</p>

<p>Every few seconds he would stop and seem
to be listening with all his might. He had seen
some strangers in his house, and though these
strangers were kind people, who meant him
no harm, the wild man did not know that, for
he had been alone so long that he had grown
a little queer.</p>

<p>After listening two or three times and hearing
no sound from his house (for Will and
Sam kept very quiet) the man walked on
again. He was now within ten feet of the
place and was walking a little faster.</p>

<p>The sailors had a good look at him. Truly
he seemed a wild person. His clothes were
tattered and torn and in one hand he carried
a big club with a knob on the end. But it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
his long hair and long and matted beard that
gave him the wildest look.</p>

<p>“He looks just like the wild man in the
circus!” whispered Sam.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet!” whispered Will. “He’ll hear
you!”</p>

<p>But the strange man did not appear to hear
the sailors. He came on, a little more slowly
now, and was almost at the door. Will and
Sam were on their tiptoes, ready to jump and
grab the fellow, when, all of a sudden, Sam
went:</p>

<p>“A-ker-choo!”</p>

<p>It was such a loud sneeze that it made Will
jump and it frightened the man outside. He
jumped, too—jumped up in the air. Perhaps
he thought that when Sam sneezed “A-ker-choo!”
he said: “I’ll catch you!”</p>

<p>At any rate, some sneezes do sound like that,
and it is no wonder the strange man was startled.
In another moment he turned around
and ran toward the woods.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve done it!” cried Will. “You’ve
scared him, Sam!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t go for to do it!” said Sam, quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
ashamed of himself. “I sure didn’t go for to
do it!”</p>

<p>“No matter, you did it!” said Will. “Now
we’ve got to run after him and catch him!
Come on!”</p>

<p>Will dashed out of the little house followed
by Sam, and the two raced after the wild man.
But the queer chap had a head start of the
sailors, and, as you know, sailors are not very
good runners at best.</p>

<p>Their legs get warped and twisted from
steadying themselves on rolling ships so much,
maybe.</p>

<p>At any rate, the wild man was well ahead of
Sam and Will. And he knew just where to
run—which paths to take through the woods.
This the sailors did not know.</p>

<p>So, after a short chase the two sailors lost
sight of the wild man. Then it was useless
for Will and Sam to keep on after him.</p>

<p>“He got away!” said Sam.</p>

<p>“And all your fault, too,” declared Will.
“What did you have to go and sneeze for?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it,” declared Sam. “Can
you stop a sneeze when you want to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Well, maybe not,” agreed Will. “But
we’ll have to go back and tell Mr. Brown we
saw this fellow but couldn’t catch him.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have another try for him,” said Sam.
“But while we’re here, let’s finish looking
around his house. Maybe we can find what
ship this came from.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Will.</p>

<p>While the wild man was running as fast as
he could to get away from those he probably
thought were his enemies, Will and Sam went
back to the little wooden house.</p>

<p>They had not looked around very long before
Sam saw something that caused him to
grasp Will by the arm and point, saying:</p>

<p>“Look at that!”</p>

<p>What Sam pointed to was a name painted
on a piece of wood behind one of the chests
in the little house. The wood was broken off
from a lifeboat, it seemed.</p>

<p>“The <em>Mary Bell</em>!” read Will, for those
were the words. “That’s the name of the ship
that was wrecked, Sam. That’s where this
deckhouse came from—the <em>Mary Bell</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the other sailor. “And—don’t
you remember?—the <em>Mary Bell</em> was the
name of the schooner that Mr. Pott sailed on—the
Mr. Pott that Bunny and Sue told us
about. You know, the man that was pitched
off his horse and they took him green apples
and buttercups in the hospital. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” said Will. “Then Mr.
Pott’s schooner, the <em>Mary Bell</em>, must have
been wrecked on this island. This deckhouse
from the wreck was washed up on shore
and this wild man has been living in it. But
there was another man—Mr. Pott’s son, you
know—a fellow named Harry, so Bunny tells.
What became of him?”</p>

<p>“That we don’t know,” replied Sam. “Nor
what became of the treasure, either. But this
is where the <em>Mary Bell</em> was wrecked.”</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Will, greatly excited.
“We’ll go back and tell Mr. Brown and then
we’ll try to catch this wild man.”</p>

<p>As the sailors turned to cross Cocoanut Island
and go back to the palm-hut camp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Bunny and Sue were getting ready to catch
the same wild man—only the children did not
know it.</p>

<p>After Will and Sam had gone that morning
and while Mr. and Mrs. Brown were talking
matters over and wondering when the <em>Beacon</em>
would come back, Bunny and Sue went a little
way from camp to look about and play.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far away, my dears,” called
Mrs. Brown. “We don’t want you to get
lost.”</p>

<p>“We won’t,” promised Bunny.</p>

<p>He and Sue found some beautiful scarlet
blossoms growing near the spring of water.</p>

<p>“Oh, how lovely! Don’t you wish we had
some like these to take to Mr. Pott in the hospital,
Bunny?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said the little boy. “Mr. Pott
would like these. And he’d like cocoanuts,
too!”</p>

<p>“Let’s take some home for him!” proposed
Sue, going toward them.</p>

<p>Before Bunny could answer there was a
rustling in the bushes near the children. At
first they thought it was just another cocoanut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
falling from a tree, for this often happened.
But a moment later Sue, looking up, saw
something that made her cry out:</p>

<p>“Look, Bunny! The wild man!”</p>

<p>Bunny glanced up and saw, thrusting itself
out of the bushes, the head and face of the
strange creature with his matted hair and
long, straggly beard.</p>

<p>Sue was just going to run and Bunny was
going to follow her when the wild man spoke.
In a very gentle voice he said:</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, children! I wouldn’t
hurt you for the world. I’m not half as wild
as I look. I’m only a poor, shipwrecked
sailor. I live in the little wooden house.
There is some one in my house now, and that’s
why I ran away from it. But don’t be afraid
of me. I won’t harm you.”</p>

<p>“I—now—I’m not afraid,” declared
Bunny.</p>

<p>“That’s right, my little chap—don’t be
afraid! I wouldn’t hurt any one,” went on
the man. “I have been very sick, and I guess
I must have been out of my head. That’s why
I ran away when I first saw you. But now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
I’m right again. I want to get off this island.
Have you folks a boat? If you have we can
sail away in her. Oh, I have been so lonesome
here! I want to get away. Have you a
boat?”</p>

<p>“My father has a boat,” said Bunny. “But
we came off a steamer and it’s coming back for
us.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” cried the man, no longer
wild. He dropped the club he carried and
walked slowly toward Bunny and Sue.</p>

<p>“Please take me to your father, children,”
he begged. “I’ll tell him who I am and how
I happened to be wrecked. Oh, I am so glad
there is a chance to get off this island! Come,
children, take me to your father.”</p>

<p>He held out his hands. Bunny took one
and Sue the other. Then the children went
back to their father and mother.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Bunny Brown and his sister
Sue caught the “wild man.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SHIP COMES BACK</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The stranger spoke so kindly to them and
seemed so sad and forlorn, that the hearts of
Bunny and his sister Sue went out to the poor
man.</p>

<p>And you can well imagine how surprised
Mr. and Mrs. Brown were when, as they sat
under the cocoanut trees talking about when
the <em>Beacon</em> would come back, they saw their
children coming down a little hill hand in
hand with the strange wild man.</p>

<p>“Look!” cried Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown rubbed his eyes as though he
could not believe what he saw. Then he cried:</p>

<p>“My gracious, it’s the wild man!”</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue walked nearer, still hand in
hand with the long-haired and matted-bearded
man, and when they were close
enough to be heard Sue called out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“We caught the wild man!”</p>

<p>And Bunny added:</p>

<p>“But he isn’t going to be wild any more and
he wants to come on our ship when it comes
back!”</p>

<p>Before Mr. or Mrs. Brown could say anything
the man hurried toward them and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It’s just as the children say! They have
caught me, but I was willing to be caught.
And I guess I have been a bit wild, living
here all alone on this island. I’ve been sick—that
made me out of my head, I reckon—and
I did all sorts of queer things. That’s why I
ran away when I first saw you people. I
hope I didn’t scare you.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know what to think. I’m very
sorry,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“I’m tame now,” and the man smiled at the
children. “But tell me,” he went on, “is it
true that you are off a ship and that the vessel
is coming back for you?”</p>

<p>“We hope so,” said Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, the <em>Beacon</em> will surely come
back,” said Mr. Brown. “She went away because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
of some accident, I’m sure. She may
be back this very day.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they will take me off?” asked
the man.</p>

<p>“Of course, if you want to leave the island,”
said Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“I certainly do want to leave the island!”
cried the man. “I have been here nearly a
year, and I am sick and tired of the place—living
all alone. That’s what made me wild,
I think—no other soul on this island but me.
I was shipwrecked and cast up here. I used
to live in that hut,” and he pointed to the
grass-and-palm-leaf shelter where the Browns
had slept.</p>

<p>“I lived there a week,” said the man, “and
then another, storm, coming after the one that
wrecked my ship, tossed up on shore the deckhouse
and some other things. So I took up my
home in the wooden cabin.”</p>

<p>“It’s a nice little house,” remarked Bunny.
“I like it.”</p>

<p>“Could we play there a little while?” Sue
asked.</p>

<p>“As much as you like,” said the wild man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
who was now tame. “But were you shipwrecked?”
he asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” answered the children’s father,
and then he told how the <em>Beacon</em> had run on a
sand-bar and how the boatload had come to
the island and how the ship, for some strange
reason, had steamed away, leaving them there.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was just going to ask the stranger
his name and the name of his shipwrecked
vessel when over the hill Sam and
Will came running. They had not caught the
wild man, but they were eager to tell Mr.
Brown about discovering the name <em>Mary Bell</em>
in the wrecked deckhouse.</p>

<p>When the two sailors saw the “wild man”
peacefully talking to their friends, Sam and
Will could hardly believe their eyesight.
They came to a sudden stop, their mouths
open.</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” murmured Will. “There’s
the wild man!”</p>

<p>“We caught him!” cried Bunny. “My sister
Sue and I—we caught the wild man!”</p>

<p>“And he isn’t wild any more!” added Sue.</p>

<p>“Shiver my marlinspike!” cried Will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>“Come here and we’ll tell you the story,”
said Mr. Brown, with a laugh at the surprise
of the sailors.</p>

<p>“But first we have something to tell you,”
said Sam. “We looked about in the wooden
house—that is, after I sneezed and scared this
man away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, was it you who sneezed?” asked the
former wild man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sam. “But I didn’t mean to.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, it turned out all right,” said
Will. “But what Sam is trying to tell you is
that we found the name <em>Mary Bell</em> on part of
a lifeboat in the deckhouse. We remembered
you folks said that was the name of the
schooner your friend Philip Pott was wrecked
on. The <em>Mary Bell</em> was wrecked here.”</p>

<p>“Of course she was!” cried the “wild man,”
as Bunny and Sue still called him in their
minds. “I was cast ashore on this island from
the wreck of the <em>Mary Bell</em>. I was second
mate aboard of her. And did I hear you mention
the name Philip Pott? I thought I heard
the children when I walked up to them speak
of a Mr. Pott, but I couldn’t be sure of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, we were talking about taking Mr.
Pott some flowers and cocoanuts,” explained
Bunny.</p>

<p>“He fell off his horse and he’s in the hospital,”
said Sue. “And he wants to find his son
Harry and the treasure.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’m his son Harry!” cried the wild
man. “That’s my name! I’m Harry Pott and
my father is Philip Pott! I wonder if it can
be the same one?”</p>

<p>“It must be,” said Mr. Brown. “There
could hardly be two men of the same name
wrecked from the <em>Mary Bell</em>. I remember
hearing the Mr. Pott who was hurt near our
house say that the name of his schooner was
<em>Mary Bell</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s the one!” cried the former wild
man. “Oh, at last I have trace of my father!
I feared he was drowned with the rest of the
crew when the <em>Mary Bell</em> was wrecked. Oh,
tell me more about my father! I am happier
than in many a long day!”</p>

<p>Then Mr. and Mrs. Brown, by turns, with
Bunny and Sue putting in words now and
then, told the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“There’s no doubt of it,” said Harry Pott
when the story was finished. “The man who
was thrown off his horse when your children
were playing store is my father. I hope he
wasn’t badly hurt!”</p>

<p>“I think he will get well,” said Mr. Brown.
“And he surely will when he hears that you
are alive. It will be good news to him.”</p>

<p>“And he wants the treasure, too,” said
Bunny Brown. “Don’t forget about the treasure!”</p>

<p>“Treasure?” repeated Harry Pott. “I don’t
know anything about any treasure. Father
must be mistaken about that. But, no matter,
we shall be happy when we meet again. Only
when do you think the <em>Beacon</em> will come back
to take us off?”</p>

<p>Before any one could answer Will Gand
leaped to his feet and pointed across the water.</p>

<p>“There she comes now!” he cried. “Hurray!
The ship is coming back for us!”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LOST TREASURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Such good news hardly seemed true.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it is our ship?” Mrs. Brown
asked her husband. “We were fooled the
other time by a sea gull. I don’t want to be
disappointed again.”</p>

<p>“This surely is a steamer,” said Sam Trend.
“I can see her smoke.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that must be the <em>Beacon</em>,” said Mr.
Brown. “I wonder what happened to her that
she stayed away so long.”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon know,” returned his wife, her
eyes shining with happiness. Though it was
very lovely on Cocoanut Island, now that the
wild man was caught, she did not want to stay
there any longer.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the vessel, appearing
to get larger each minute.</p>

<p>Bunny and Sue ran up and down the sand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
in delight while their mother, their father, the
two sailors and Harry Pott looked with eager
eyes over the stretch of water.</p>

<p>“Hope she doesn’t come so close she gets on
the sand-bar again, Will,” murmured Sam to
his mate.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed the other. “But I
guess Captain Ward will be careful. We
wouldn’t have gone on at first if it hadn’t been
for the fog at night.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later loud whistles broke out
from the ship to let the castaways know she
was coming to rescue them.</p>

<p>“That’s the <em>Beacon</em> all right!” cried Sam.
“I know her tooting. First I thought it might
be some other steamer she was sending after
us. But she’s the <em>Beacon</em>!”</p>

<p>So it proved. A little later a boat put off
from the anchored ship which came to a stop
a safe distance away from the island and the
sand-bar. Those on the <em>Beacon</em> did not wait
for the castaways on the island to launch the
boat they had.</p>

<p>In the craft that put off from the ship was
Captain Ward and some of his sailors. Running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
up the beach to where Mr. and Mrs.
Brown stood with the children and the others
and holding out his hands, the commander
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry this happened and that
you were left behind! It was all due to an
accident and because I was hurt. We never
would have gone away and left you except for
that!”</p>

<p>“We knew it was an accident,” said Mr.
Brown. “And, really, we have had a very
good time here. We have an extra passenger
for you to take back if you will,” and he motioned
to Harry Pott.</p>

<p>“A regular castaway, I take it,” said the
captain.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been here nearly a year,” said
Harry Pott.</p>

<p>“But what happened to the <em>Beacon</em>?” asked
Mrs. Brown.</p>

<p>“Several things happened,” explained Captain
Ward. “In the first place, her steering
gear was damaged in the hurricane and also
when we ran on the sand-bar, but we didn’t
know that. Everything seemed to be all right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
when you folks went ashore, and then we
waited until high tide and started to pull the
ship off the bar.</p>

<p>“We managed that part all right and were
backing away when we found the steering
gear wouldn’t work after we had turned the
ship about to head away from the island. But
even that would have been all right had it not
been that while I was giving orders something
fell from up above and hit me and my first
mate on our heads. We were knocked unconscious
and remained so for a long time.</p>

<p>“This made so much excitement on the ship,
together with the breaking of the rudder, that
no one thought anything about you folks left
on the island. In fact, very few of those on
board knew you had gone off for a little picnic,
though I knew and so did my mate. But
we were both unconscious.</p>

<p>“Well, while I was lying in this state in my
berth, the second mate, knowing nothing about
you folks left here, kept the ship steaming
away. She could move straight ahead, but
could not turn about. And the second mate
wanted to get as far away as possible from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
dangerous sand-bar. So he went for many
miles before dropping anchor.</p>

<p>“And there we were, disabled, many miles
away from the island, and here you were, marooned.
I tell you I felt mighty sorry about
it when I came to and asked about you,” said
Captain Ward. “And when I found you
hadn’t come back on board and no one had
gone after you, I was nearly wild with worry.</p>

<p>“I wanted to put back and take you off at
once. But, to add to our troubles, when we
got the steering gear fixed the engines got out
of order and we couldn’t move at all.</p>

<p>“Of course the engineers worked as hard as
they could to make repairs, and it was only a
little while ago that we could turn around and
come back to get you. All the while the machinery
was being fixed I had a man on a lookout
for some other ship to send to rescue you,
but we saw none. Our wireless was out of
order, so we couldn’t radio about you to any
other ship. But as soon as we got things fixed
up we came back in a hurry, and here we are!”</p>

<p>“We’re glad to see you,” laughed Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
Brown. “Really, we haven’t been so badly
off. We have had a good shelter and plenty
to eat.”</p>

<p>“But we were all excited about the wild
man,” said Bunny.</p>

<p>“And we caught him—Bunny and I!” put
in Sue.</p>

<p>“Wild man?” asked Captain Ward.</p>

<p>“I guess they called me that,” said Harry
Pott. And then he told his story—how he had
been shipwrecked with the <em>Mary Bell</em>. “My
father and I were on board,” explained the
long-haired sailor, “when we ran into the big
storm. I had been sick for some time and
couldn’t do much. My father tried to save
me when the ship broke up, but we got separated.
He managed to get in a boat, but I
couldn’t. I clung to part of the wreckage and
got ashore.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you save the treasure?” asked
Bunny Brown.</p>

<p>“What’s this about treasure?” asked Harry
Pott. “I never had any, and my father didn’t
either, that I know of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>They told the son what Mr. Pott had raved
about in the hospital. Then a look of remembrance
came over Harry Pott’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, I recall now that when my father went
off in the lifeboat he called to me about saving
the treasure,” he said.</p>

<p>“But what was the treasure?” asked Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>“It must have been something in my father’s
sea chest,” said the castaway sailor. “I know
he kept very close watch over it and more than
once he said to me it contained something valuable.
But I was too sick to pay much attention.”</p>

<p>“Then is the treasure lost?” asked Mrs.
Brown.</p>

<p>“Well, my father’s chest came ashore with
some other stuff,” said Harry Pott. “It’s in
the deckhouse now. I’ve never opened it. I
was too sad and miserable here, a castaway
all by myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, if there’s a treasure here we don’t
want to leave it behind,” said Mr. Brown.
“Your father seemed very anxious about it,
Harry. Let’s have a look at it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>When they reached the deckhouse a little
later and opened Mr. Philip Pott’s chest, the
treasure was found to be a lot of old-fashioned
silver dishes—a teapot, a sugar bowl, a coffee
urn, and such things as that.</p>

<p>“Oh, what wonderful silver!” cried Mrs.
Brown when she saw it. “That is, indeed, a
treasure! Where did it come from?”</p>

<p>“That silver has been in our family a long
time,” said Harry. “Just before my father
and I sailed together on the <em>Mary Bell</em> an old
aunt of father’s died and gave us this silver.
I didn’t think much about it, and I didn’t
know my father called it his treasure until
you people mentioned it. I don’t believe it’s
worth much—old silver like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, it is worth a lot of money!”
said Mrs. Brown. “It is very beautiful and
old. Dealers will give a lot for that.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have it put on board the <em>Beacon</em>
and kept safely for Mr. Pott,” said Captain
Ward. “And now I think we had better
get back to the ship, for there may be another
storm or a fog and I don’t want to get caught
on the sand-bar again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>A little later the castaways, including
Harry Pott and his chest of silver, were rowed
out to the <em>Beacon</em> and soon the vessel was
steaming on her way again.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Cocoanut Island!” called Sue,
waving her hands over the rail to the place
where they had had so many strange adventures.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” echoed Bunny Brown. “Now
we’re on the rolling ocean again!”</p>

<p>Mr. Harry Pott was well taken care of on
board the steamer. His hair and beard were
trimmed and he was given some clothes to replace
the ones made ragged by his lonely life
of a year on the island.</p>

<p>“Now I feel better,” he said. “And when
I get to my father I shall be very happy.”</p>

<p>“And he’ll be glad to see you and the treasure,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>As the <em>Beacon</em> still had many miles of
travel before her and as Harry Pott was
anxious to get back to see his father, the ship
stopped at the nearest port and the castaway
and his chest of silver went ashore, to take
passage in another steamer that would carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
him back to Philadelphia. From there he
could go by train to Bellemere. This he did,
as Bunny and Sue learned a few weeks later.</p>

<p>The Browns remained on board the <em>Beacon</em>
and went to the West Indies, where they had
a wonderful time and many strange adventures
of which I have not room in this book to
tell you.</p>

<p>At last Bunny and Sue reached home again,
off the rolling ocean, and among the first to
greet them was Harry Pott and his father.
Mr. Pott had been cured in the hospital and
was quite well again.</p>

<p>“And I’m never going to ride any more
horses!” he said.</p>

<p>“Did you get the treasure all right?” Bunny
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Indeed I did!” cried Mr. Pott. “And if it
hadn’t been that you children teased to go
ashore on the island, perhaps I never would
have found it, nor Harry either.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” exclaimed Sue. “Then Bunny
and I found your treasure for you, didn’t we,
Mr. Pott?”</p>

<p>“That’s what you did, little girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“And his son Harry, too,” added Bunny.
“Don’t forget, Sue, that we found the wild
man, and that the wild man isn’t a wild man
any more but is Mr. Pott’s son Harry.”</p>

<p>As Mrs. Brown had thought, the old silver
was valuable, and while the fortune was not a
very large one, the pieces were sold for
enough to satisfy Mr. Pott. He and his son
remained in Bellemere some time before again
taking passage as sailors.</p>

<p>So all ended happily, for which Bunny
Brown and his sister Sue were very glad.</p>

<p>“Next year maybe we’ll have some more adventures,”
said Bunny.</p>

<p>“I hope we do,” said Sue.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
